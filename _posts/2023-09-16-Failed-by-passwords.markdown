Life was easy without passwords. Life was easy even with passwords in the beginning. There were very few online things that required use of passwords. Simple ones like ‘1234’ and ‘password’ were accepted. First name along with year of birth was a hit. ‘coolgirl’ and ‘hotboy’ were ego boosters.

Things started getting out of hand when conditions cropped up like – minimum eight letters, one capital letter and one small letter, one numeric and one special character. No problems. I experimented with – “Eight@88”, “Whynot7?”, ”Seven+01”. I wonder how they decided on figure eight.

Then came the hackers and blackmailers. They had more wisdom than the collective wisdom of the password users. One would receive an email from one’s own mail account. With every line the heart would sink one inch at a time till it almost falls to the ground and goes into fibrillation there. The mail would read something like – “This email is the proof that I know the password to your email and all your other accounts. I have been watching you for a long time and know what you’ve been surfing on your computer including those adult sites. Pay me in bitcoin else I will make the data public.” The last line would be – “Don’t think changing the password now will be of any help, I will get to know the new password also and then my demand will increase 10 fold.” At that moment one rushes to clean up the history and delete everything from the computer. And of course, change the passwords. Now we know the importance of using clever and complicated passwords!

To confuse the matter further, sites started asking for change of passwords regularly. And they wont allow repeat of the last three passwords. It takes plenty of brain energy to generate a password that one can remember and then even more energy to remember it. It becomes redundant in 6 months’ time and it is used not even 6 times. I tried “Ihaveteeth=32” which I thought I will change to “Ihavedentures=2” later on in life.

And the ultimate. The stupid hint questions. They are supposed to help when one forgets the password. But how do the techies expect us to remember the answers to these questions when we could not remember the damn password?

Look at the questions:

Where was your mother born?
If you were a vegetable, which one would you be?
What is the name of your secret crush from kindergarten?
Which is the most underrated planet according to you?

I would rather tax my brain to remember the passwords than to answer these questions.

Very soon the brain will undergo further evolution and develop a specific area to generate and store passwords. The only risk will be, undergo CT scan or MRI, and all your passwords will be printed in the films and the report. Go to a doctor whom you can trust. Or encrypt the passwords in your brain and store the encryption key in your laptop, secured with a password.
