“Sir, I am calling from Money Bank. You have been selected for a special loan.” A sweet sounding girl tried to make me feel special. I had just answered a call on my mobile from an unknown number.

Oh no, not again. Telemarketing.

Usually I don’t answer calls from unknown numbers. But there are days when one is expecting some important call and not sure it will come from which number. It was one of those days.

I have passed through many phases in my reaction to marketing calls.

First phase was, “How did you get my number?” My tone was stern.

“Sir, we are provided a list of numbers by our supervisor to call and convey the offer.” The guy explained as a matter of fact.

“Let me talk to your supervisor.” I threw the challenge.

“That is not possible sir.” More matter of fact.

“OK, remove my number from your call list. If I ever get a call from you again, I will take you to court.” There was nothing more I could do.

In second phase I realised, it is much easier to say no and disconnect. You don’t even have to say no actually, just disconnect.

Right now I am passing through the third phase.

Why should the caller have all the fun? And I decided to have my own fun at their expense.

“Sir, I am calling from Money Bank. You have been selected for a special loan.” A sweet sounding girl tried to make me feel special.

“Thank you miss. Since it is a special loan and I have been selected for it, I believe I won’t have to repay it.” I was actually beaming.

“No sir, you have to repay.” She clarified.

“Then it must be interest free?” I sound optimistic.

“12% interest rate is there, sir.” She was still sounding sweet.

“You are the special one, miss. You keep the loan for you.” Time to disconnect.

Then there are calls from holiday planners. They always want me to come with my wife to attend a forty five minute presentation and get a free coupon for three day stay at one of their resorts. Once I availed such coupon. I was offered stay in the off season difficult weather. And the kitchen charges were high enough to compensate for free stay. I stopped going to such presentations.

“Sir, you are requested to attend a presentation with your wife and avail three day free stay.” Again,
a sweet voice.

“My wife has abandoned me.” I informed him.

“Sir, you can come with other couple.” I was provided an option.

“I can come alone. Give me the coupon and I will take someone with me for vacation.” I try to find my way in.

“No sir. That is not the company policy. You have to come with your wife.” He firewalls me.

Why do they think wives will be a great influence on husbands to buy such plans?

“That’s bad policy, whosoever devised it. Tell the policy makers that a single man can also be potential buyer of the scheme. You are leaving out all the rich unmarried men. Bad move.” I leave my message hoping it will open door for single men.

Then there are calls from jewellers.

“Sir, we have special offer for you.”

I keep wondering if I really am a special person.

“This week we are offering 10% discount on labour charges.” The lady informed me.

“I also have an offer for you.” I responded.

“What sir?” She was slightly confused.

“I work at a hospital and there is 10% discount on surgeries. Would you like to get your gall bladder removed?” I made my offer.

She disconnected the call.
