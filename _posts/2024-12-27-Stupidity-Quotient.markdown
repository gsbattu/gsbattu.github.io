Earlier we were taught – its all about common sense and as the name denotes, it is supposed to be very common.

Soon it changed to – common sense is not very common.

But no body told us when things changed to – stupidity is in the air. It hangs in the air like thick invisible smog. People exhale stupidity.

You have to literally change your path or duck your head to escape banging into stupidity while on an outing.

Carlo Cipolla studied human stupidity and formulated many laws. In 1976. Here are the salient ones:

Since 1976, magnitude of the problem has increased manifold.

It was stupid of me that I did not know these facts. No, don’t take it personally if even you also did not know this.

Ever since I realized the wisdom of stupidity quotient, I have started noticing the stupidity all around. It is so abundant on the roads, to begin with. While everyone is waiting patiently in line for traffic to move, few drivers with high Stupidity Quotient, break the line and move ahead to make sure there is a grid jam. Nonstop honking, driving on the wrong side, road rage – stupidity comes in different shapes and sizes.

All such drivers should be allotted vehicle number series  – SQ01, SQ02 and so on – where SQ does not denote country or state, but the high Stupidity Quotient. Stop wondering about moving vehicles, even the parked vehicles are a testimony to the SQ of the owner. Highest score goes to the person who parks the car blocking some other vehicle and walks off. Forget the VIPs, SQ series vehicles should come with a red light on top, so that we all can keep away from that vehicle.

Let us not underestimate the number of stupid people in circulation. This statement is so profound. Should we consider all persons stupid until and unless proven otherwise? Other people will think the same about you.

Is stupidity infectious? I guess so. If one person does something stupid, many others tend to follow. And do stupid people flock together? I wonder.

Then there are stupidities at offices, work places and homes.

We have a dog and we have fish at home.

Lady of the house takes care of them. She feeds the dog and the fish. She keeps the dog and the fish warm in winters. So many similarities. But then I noticed one discrepancy and asked her – “Why is it that you give bath to the dog, but not to the fish?”

She looked at me and said, “I refuse to answer stupid questions.”

Maybe I am adding more to the overall stupidity quotient of the country than I realise.
