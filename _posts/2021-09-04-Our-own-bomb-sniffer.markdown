“This breed is used by forces all over the world to sniff bombs, drugs and other contraband.” The kennel guy said. We were looking for a pup as a pet, who could grow big and intelligent. I was going out of station for better job prospects. So it was decided to have someone at home who could add to the safety profile of the house. I am not big by any imagination, so the dog had to be big. We will not go into the intelligence evaluation of mine, but the dog must be intelligent.

So this breeding and kennel guy was pitching for a Labrador pup. “They are highly trainable.” The pup was so cute. Innocence was oozing out of its eyes. It looked at us as if he knew us from the previous birth. The look in the eyes was more captivating than the sales pitch of the guy.

That is how Scooby, one month old Labrador, arrived at our house.

Everyone was so excited at the thought of a ‘trained’ dog. We had seen so many movies and news clips where dogs behave in perfect sync with their masters. Terror for thieves and still so playful and coy for the trainer or the family.

Search for a trainer was started and one recommended by other dog owners was shortlisted.

He came visiting one evening.

“Such a pretty pup.” He started.

We all felt so proud and delighted at our choice.

“But its too early as yet, we can wait for few months.” He promised to be back after three months.

And he was back.

Scooby was handed over to him with great expectations. He started training him to the commands of shake hand, sit, sit low, fetch, stay.

He learnt to shake hand real quick. We were so happy to have such an intelligent and trainable pup. Soon he was obeying other commands also.

The trainer left after three months, satisfied with his own capabilities.

But there was one catch. Scooby was obeying commands of the trainer only. He would ignore every command of ours.

“Scooby sit.” I would say.

He would wag his tail and run in circles as if challenging me.

“Scooby fetch” I would say as I throw the ball.

He would grab the ball and run away, I never got the ball back.

Only thing that he would do on demand was shake hand. We were confused. Such a trainable dog could not have gone wrong. Must be something with the trainer.

He was not only not obeying commands, he was also trying to find contraband all over the house. Socks and shoes were torn apart. Edges of all furniture were chewed off. Even curtains were suspect and their corners were reduced to shreds.

Hunt for a right trainer began again. This time we interviewed all the dog owners that we knew.

We observed behavior of all dogs. We could not reach a unanimous decision and selected one trainer on split votes.

“Previous trainer made one mistake. He did not ‘hand over’ the dog to you.” New trainer announced. “He should have made sure that the pet obeys your commands also.”

We were happy, finally we had a trainer who would train Scooby and ‘hand over’ to us.

Again the same cycle of commands, Scooby once again was doing everything that he was told to do. After three months, trainer left.

We were not sure he missed the ‘hand over’ part or we failed to note and capture the process.

Soon, Scooby was making fun of every command. He only remembered ‘shake hand’. He learnt to use it in different ways. He puts his paw on our foot or arm if he wants to be patted. He taps his bowl if he is hungry.

As far as security of the house is concerned, he runs to the gate whenever the bell rings. He rushes with his tail wagging and wants to welcome and meet the person as a long lost friend.

Thus ten years and two trainers later, we have a Labrador who is not bothered about any command, sleeps most of the time and every visitor is his closest friend.

Bomb sniffer? May be there was some communication gap. Scooby is best bum sniffer.
