Ding Dong.

The sound of the doorbell was stern.

Being the man of the house, it was upon me to answer to that mean sounding bell. I was alone at home, so there was no other option also.

There were two men at the door, with a very official look and an air of authority. “We are from the municipal corporation and are checking the houses for dengue.” The junior looking guy announced.

“Oh yes, I had it last year, but now no one in the house has it.” I informed them happily.

“No sir, we are checking the houses for breeding mosquitoes.”

Oh. Who breeds mosquitoes?

He looked over his shoulder and I followed his gaze. There were two other teams of two, they were ringing the bells of other houses. But the smarter occupants did not respond. Seeing me at the gate, the other four also joined the team at my gate. So soon I had six people swarming in my little front of the house which has more potted plants and other garden paraphernalia than it can actually handle.

They looked into each and every pot and anything else that could store water. It was all clean. There was a happy and proud gleam in my eyes. Until one guy found some suspicious water collection in some remote innocent looking pot.

He brought the pot to the fore. “This water has mosquito larvae in it.” The other five looked at it as if their eyes were fitted with microscopes and nodded in unison. The guy extended his arm to show the thing to me. My eyes are not fitted with microscope. I could not make out anything. One against six was a lost battle.

“You have to appear in front of the commissioner tomorrow and pay the fine.” The senior one announced triumphally.

May be I can beat them with my wisdom.

“For what?” I put on the most childlike look on my face.

“For spreading dengue.”

“Are those dengue larvae?” I asked.

“No, these are mosquito larvae.”

“So maybe I am spreading mosquitoes and not dengue?” Let’s be technical! “I have a dog also, does that mean I am spreading rabies?”

“That is your pet dog and you must have vaccinated him.”

“And these are the mosquitoes that you guys send to our houses when you do the fogging on the roads.” I was raking all parts of my brain to counter the allegation. “What if I say these are my pet mosquitoes and they are vaccinated too?”

“Tell us how many you have, give us their names and show us the vaccination certificates.”

Need to change the line of discussion. “But I pay my property tax, that means corporation should take the responsibility of keeping my house free of such invaders.” I challenged him.

“That is collected by the other branch, we are concerned with public health.” Came the counter.

“What about the water collections alongside the roads and the water body in the middle of the city?”

“Roadside water collections have no owners, so we don’t waste our efforts there. Our aim is not just to find larvae, but to collect the fine from the owner of the property. And for the water body in the city, we placed the challan in the hand of statue of Gandhi ji that is there on a platform in the waterbody.”

“What happened then?” I was curious now.

“Nothing. Gandhi ji smiled and returned the challan saying – ‘I am there on every note that you receive officially or unofficially’ – and we had to agree.”

So I had to pay the Dengue Tax. I looked at the Gandhi ji on the note. He was smiling at me, as if making fun of me. Now I am paying property tax for nothing, water bill for the official connection which has not supplied water since long, sewerage tax for the sewerage that gets choked every monsoon and backflows in the house and now the Dengue tax in addition to the hospital bill where I was admitted with dengue. All this in addition to the income tax that I pay regularly.

I hope they don’t tax the oxygen that I breathe in, claiming it to be a government property.
