I have two weaknesses in life – beautiful girls and gulabjamuns. The philosophy of life has always been to appreciate beautiful girls and consume gulabjamuns, never the other way round.

“One kilo gulabjamun please.” I addressed the guy at the counter of a sweets shop. Half kilo would be for me and the other half for the rest of the family. I was a young boy at that time.

The guy took out a box and started putting in the gulabjamuns in neat rows.

“No no.” I protested, “Give them to me in a paper bag.” My only concern was that since the box itself would weigh a lot, I would be deprived of at least one gulabjamun.

“They will get crushed in paper bag, box is better option.” He replied without taking a pause in the process.

To my horror, he placed the lid under the box while placing it on the weighing scale. Time to fight for my gulabjamun, I realised.

“Add extra sweets to compensate for the weight of the box.” Even I was surprised at the stern tone that was produced by my resolute vocal cords. The guy looked at me for few seconds. I looked back.

He added one extra piece without saying anything.

That was my first victory over collateral damage of sweets boxes.
It was years later when I started earning and had to spend from my own pocket that other realisation hit me about the innocuous looking sweets boxes. Vendors were selling me the card board boxes at the same rate as the stuff contained within. If I bought simple laddus worth couple of hundred rupees, I was paying the same rate for the box that was weighed along with. And if it is some fancy stuff worth thousand rupees, I was paying the same rate for the box. WHAT?
I started approaching the problem from a different angle.

“Weigh me one kg of sweets without the box and charge me extra for the box.” I proposed to every vendor I visited.

None of them agreed to it. They just laughed about it and added extra quantity. I might have sounded stupid to other people in the queue, but I placed myself at least 10 points higher on the IQ scale than them.

In their quest to attack the society from different angles, sweets boxes arrived on the scene in a much bigger way. Just like a seemingly harmless but much more infectious virus.

They started appearing with marriage invitation cards. And this new variant is spreading as if it’s in a competition with itself. Getting bigger and fanciful. Few of them were actually bigger than the small carry bags at my home. Most of them so beautifully crafted and lined with silken cloth, one feels like displaying them in the drawing room. In the beginning, I started collecting them so that I can store my titbits in them. Very soon they were occupying more space than the titbits. So I had to discard them.

Sometimes I feel the cost of the box must have been more than the stuff it contains. And the cost to me? It was much more than the cost I paid at the sweets shop. The Shagun has to commensurate with the size and fanciness of the box.
