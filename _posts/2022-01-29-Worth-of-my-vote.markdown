The year 1985 was the watershed year for me.

I became eligible to cast my vote. It was such a proud moment for me. Suddenly I felt so empowered and responsible. Now onwards, I shall be playing a role in deciding who governs the state and the country. I could not take the present and the future of the country lightly.

I talked to my parents. They were the go-by-the-party voters. They believed in ideologies of different parties. Like typical spouses who always disagree, they could not agree on one party. This divergence was not of acrimonious value since it happened only once every five years. They would just report at the voting center, go to different booths and mark their ballot. No questions asked, none replied. They were democratic to the core on this issue.

To me they advised, “Use your brains, look at the performance of the party and the candidate and do whatever you feel is right.”

I found two catches in the advice. One was – ‘use your brains.’ My brain was as raw as they come, at least for voting process that is so complicated and of such national importance. In my opinion, all first time voters should get notified during the previous elections, before they become eligible for voting – ‘Please study the process during this election so that you can use your brain and vote effectively in the next elections.’

Second catch was – ‘do whatever you feel is right.’ It was not about what I feel is right, it is all about what is right for the country. My vote has to decide which way the country and all the residents are steered. I should not start with a wrong step.

So I started with going through the ideologies of the parties.

One party claimed to have secured independence for India. That sounded so wonderful. I was immediately impressed. But then I realised, the people who had fought for the rights of the country, were long gone and the baton was being passed down the family tree. It was like a family pension. More like ruler kings where the heir would be the next king.

Then there are parties based loosely on caste or religion. How can one religion be superior to other when all the religions have teachings on equality of mankind.

Regional parties and parties run by certain families add to the list.

I looked at the candidates.

It was even more surprising. Majority of the candidates were same in every elections. It was like musical chairs. One set wins one time and the other set next time. For the want of the chair, many players changed their team and joined the other party. They all seemed to have money and muscle power. Education and qualities were no criteria. Many had criminal past. Best were the candidates in fray who were currently in jail.

I had a look at the pre poll promises of the parties. They were impressive. They had a vision for the state and the country, I was made to believe. They had the road map to generate employment, policies to eradicate illiteracy and poverty. But wait, why could they not do it when they were in power last?

Then I realised. It was more about being in ‘power’ rather than serving the cause of the nation.

And now to get my and others’ votes, people are being offered electricity at rates lowered specifically for the canvassing period, few thousand rupees for the females of the state, a miniscule cut in colossal fuel prices. Many get their share of liquor, drugs and cash.

No one wants votes in the name of growth of the country, peace and harmony, or elimination of corruption.

I voted so many times in the coming years.

Did the party I voted for, win the elections? Not always.

Did the candidate I voted for, win the elections? Not always.

Do the candidates really qualify to be there on the ballot list? Not always.

Is the country being steered in the right direction? With only 2-3% of the population paying taxes, I have my doubts.

We all must make efforts to make sure our democracy does not become a demo(n)cracy.
