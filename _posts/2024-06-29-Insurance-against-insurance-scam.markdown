It all started with the change of car.

“Hello sir… congratulations for the new car. I am calling to discuss the insurance.”

“Of course. Please do the needful.” I replied as I was impressed with the promptness of the service.

“Yes sir. If you will please let me know what all options you will require.” Sweet sounding girl at the other end asked.

“Options? I need insurance for the car. Isn’t that enough?” Suddenly the sweet voice at the other end seemed suspicious to me.

“Would you like to opt for roadside assistance sir?” Still so sweet.

“Are you suggesting the car will break down in the middle of the road?” I was wondering about my choice of car.

“No sir. But accidents happen on the road only.”

“I have had no accident in my forty years of driving. But yes, the incidence of road rage is increasing. Will you send bouncers to the roadside to help me fight rowdy three-wheelers?”

“No sir, we will send the pickup vehicle to tow away the car.”

I thought and decided against it. “No. Skip that.”

“What about insurance for lost keys, sir?”

I have never lost a car key. Or any key for that matter.

“What about lost key moments in life?” I asked.

“We will skip that sir. Insurance against wrong fuel? I mean if someone fills diesel instead of petrol?”

Never happened with me. “Will it be valid also if someone fills the tank with beer?” If stupidity was the criteria of the question, I am capable of taking it further.

“No sir, drinks are not allowed in the car. What about protection against floods?”

“Why only floods, I would like to have insurance against volcano eruption, Russian rockets and Israeli drones also.” Now I was in the exploratory mode.

“Sir we insure only against the threats prevalent in the area.” There was a drop in the sweetness.

“Okay. That means I can have insurance against bird droppings and fights with my wife in the car?”

She ignored my question.

“I have no claim bonus on my existing car insurance. Will it help if I carry forward the same to new insurance?” I asked.

“Sure sir. Just get the certificate.”

It was same brand car and insurance was done through car agency only. Should be a cake walk.

I paid Rs 7500/- to get the certificate and forwarded the same for the new car.

“It is done sir. You got a discount of Rs 2400/- for the no claim bonus. The insurance documents will be handed over to you soon.”

What? Rs 7500/- for a discount of Rs 2400/-?

“Do you have any insurance against insurance scams?” I asked in a sarcastic tone.

“I will get back to you on that, sir.” Sweetness at the other end left a bitter taste.

I am sure, insurance companies will devise any and every cover, as long as they find people to pay the premium.

Why has the government made vehicle insurance mandatory and not the health insurance? Anyone who can buy a car can pay for the repair or the other damages also. Instead of asking him to get the car insured, ask him to pay for health insurance of someone who can’t afford it.
