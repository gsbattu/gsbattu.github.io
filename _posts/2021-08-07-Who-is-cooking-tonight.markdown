Husband – “Way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.”
Wife – “Here are my observation on that pathway:
1. This is such an archaic theory, holds true only if you still believe earth is flat.
2. It smells of sexism and chauvinism, rather than condiments and spices.
3. You should stop observing female anatomy on TV and learn more about your own heart and stomach.”

Such is the journey of culinary art and woman empowerment.
First edible thing that goes into our mouth at birth, is mother’s milk. Last thing to traverse that route is Ganga Jal. In between birth and death, we test our intestines and check their ability to withstand every kind of food. Most of the times, the intestines keep their patience and absorb whatever is stuffed into them. Occasionally, they revolt and throw out the things from either end.

Food cooked by mother always holds a special place and by default becomes a benchmark. Mothers do cook fabulous food, but the fact that we grow up eating that only, makes us believe that this is how the food should be cooked. Any deviation, and we burp out the comparisons.

For a man, the switch over from the food cooked by mother to the food cooked by wife, is a watershed event. The wife has grown up relishing the food cooked by her mother. “Food cooked by your mother can not be better than food cooked by my mother.” It takes some deft handling and application of wit to praise both sets of flavors without upsetting the other chef.
It is around that time that the man starts cooking.
It is a win win situation for all. Man gets accolades for working in kitchen. Mother and wife both love him and are all praise for the food.
Majority of world famous chefs are males. The reason that I see for that is, men cook as a hobby. Everyday cooking has been assigned to the ladies of the house by default. This is irrespective of their working status. Start with breakfast. Everyone in the house has different demands. And the lady being a daughter or a wife or a mother, caters to all the demands. There is very little gap between finishing up the breakfast and start preparing for the lunch. Same for lunch and dinner. I am sure, husbands can never achieve that feat.

Men are happy cooking once in a while. They cook only when they themselves are in a mood to party. They are aware of the fact that asking for something elaborate, or extra from the routine daily food, can backfire. The denial can be accompanied by some unpalatable comments.
That makes the world flush with male chefs. We have three kinds of male chefs.

First is the professional kind. They cook for five star hotels, write books on cooking, and appear on Youtube. Apart from cooking food, they are very good at cooking up the names of the dishes that they make. One can find such fancy names for the most mundane dishes. And I am sure, they must be bringing to office their own food, cooked by the mother or wife.

Second is ‘no-other-option’ kind. These are the guys who are living away from home, who never got married, or the wife left unable to bear the guy. They don’t cook anything special and are happy eating the leftovers in the fridge. They are more dependent on canned or precooked food. Quality of their output is much below the level of female counterparts.

Third type is the most common kind. The chef here are married and can be found in every middle class household. It is self-gratifying and peace keeping cooking. It has the most amazing results. Intention of such cooks is not to earn money or to feed other people. The whole creativity is centered around pleasing one’s own taste buds. Efforts are replete with sincerity and a sense of purpose. Results are there for all to relish.

My salute to all the male chefs. They have accepted the fact that earth is round and not flat and that cooking is not the albatross designed for women.
And how to woo a woman? Let us find out if the way to her heart is through her stomach.
