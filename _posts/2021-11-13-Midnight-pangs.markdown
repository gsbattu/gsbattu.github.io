Clock struck midnight.

Match struck the box and lit the candles on the cake.

The whole family struck the chord and swarmed me.

“Happy Birthday.” I was woken up from a well-deserved sleep. I woke up with mixed feelings. I was wondering about the trade-off between midnight wishes and blissful sleep. But the enthusiasm and emotions were real and infectious.

It is not in our hands to decide when and where to be born. Or, to be born or not to be born. We cannot choose our parents, place, or country of birth. Our existence is conceptualised in the heat of moment. Few of us are the wanted outcome of the union of the bodies while few others are not the desired fruits of labour. We just happen.

But yes, I believe birthdays are to be celebrated. Whether we are delivered in this world wanted or unwanted, arrive we did. And that calls for celebrations.

“What is there to celebrate? I am one year older today.” I have heard many a pessimist lament.

Come on guys, today is the day when you are youngest in your life. Tomorrow you will be one day older. Don’t lament for today, commemorate it.

Birthday celebrations evolve with age.

When I was a kid, birthdays were celebrated by the parents.

Birthday would mean playing games with other kids. Room would be decorated with balloons and ribbons. Kids would stream in carrying gifts.

“Let us see what you have brought.” I would announce as the gift is handed over to me.

“No, not now, we will open all the gifts together in the evening.” Parents would rush to advise me. They would take the gift from me and put it on the table, kept on the side for this specific purpose. It was a pleasure to see the mount of gifts grow on the table. It would take great effort to resist the temptation of opening gifts there and then.

“Where is the gift?” I would ask any kid walking in without one. “You won’t get the cake.”

“Don’t say that.” Mom or dad would always be nearby to check my uncivilised utterances.

Parents would come to drop and pick kids. They would have cake and make small talk with my parents. Few would pinch my cheeks and wish me a happy birthday. Evening would end with ceremonial opening of gift packs. My friendship with other kids in the coming days would depend on my liking for the gift that they brought.

When I joined professional college and had my own set of friends, birthdays would be celebrated by me. It was customary to cut a small cake with parents. The real party would be with friends.

“Are you inviting your friends?” Mom or dad would ask.

“Yes, but we will go to some pizza joint and party there.”

And to compensate for the change in celebratory venue, I would bring a small cake and cut it with parents and then go out. It did not take many birthdays for beer to get added to pizzas. That would mean more time with friends and late-night parties.

Now being on the wrong side of fifties, it is the kids who celebrate my birthdays. And they have their own style and timings. The latest trend with them is to start the celebrations in the first few minutes of the day. Celebrations begin as the day begins at midnight.

“Happy Birthday” is announced with candle lit cake and faces lit with affection. It is difficult not to get involved.

Apart from disturbed sleep, other pain point is getting pics clicked in the night suit and unkempt appearance. Nice poses and smiles don’t compensate for untidy looks. And then the kids tend to share it with friends and relatives over the social media. Okays, even at this age, I want to look good in pics. So now I tend to sleep in day clothes on all birthday eves.

Better to change with times rather than letting time overwhelm you. Do celebrate your birthdays, we owe our life to our birth.

Everyday should be celebrated and don’t forget, today you are the youngest in your life.
