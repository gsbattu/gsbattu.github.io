It is a simple broom. Without any motor or pulleys or levers. Still, it worked better than a vacuum cleaner. Without making a sound, it cleaned the trash so very efficiently.

Our correspondent (C) approached Mr Broom (MB) for an interview.

C: Congratulations, MB. This is the most effective sweep people have ever seen.

MB: Thank you. It must have been some visionary in the Election Commission who allotted this symbol to us. We took the symbol very seriously and decided to clean up the country, state by state.

C: You acted as a spoilsport for the native players.

MB: They were playing pass the baton game. Apparently, they were different teams, but people realised that they were the same. They were taking the general population for granted. Not only did we stop the passing baton, we will also stop the buck.

C: What worked for you?

MB: Other parties worked for us. (Chuckles). They were so busy fighting each other for the top post, they failed to notice the new entrant in the arena. We just worked our way while they scored plenty of self-goals. In their misplaced self-confidence, they committed hara-kiri. Spectators got fed up with their dirty games and chose to cheer the new image party.

C: A simple broom can be an efficient tool.

MB: Yes indeed. It looks so simple but is very versatile. During our childhood, mothers used it to spank our bottoms to shake out any bad habits. So we very well know how to use it. More than 99% of India uses it to clean houses, offices, and roads. Everyone can afford it. It is not dependent on electricity and requires no repairs. There is no malfunction. Wizards have used brooms to travel also.

C: That means you will be playing the role of a janitor.

MB: A very efficient janitor. Majority of garbage had been swept under the carpet by the earlier caretakers. It was done just to make it disappear from the eyes of the public. We know there are sand mines, drugs and corruption under the carpet. We will remove the carpet along with the garbage.

Broom will make sure the house is clean actually and no trash hides in the corners or crevices. Broom is the tool of local superman.

C: Comedians becoming state heads, is it the new world order?

MB: Thanks to Mr Zelenski for starting the trend. Comedy is a serious business. People tend to get serious about every and anything, it takes a comedian to make them see a lighter side in everything.

Better to have a comedian at the helm of affairs rather than a joker.

C: Thank you MB for your time and comments. I know you have a lot to do. All the best for your maiden innings.
