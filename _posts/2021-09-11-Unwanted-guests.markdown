I was looking at uncle. Uncle was looking at the corners of the ceiling. His gaze oscillated from one corner to the other. I wondered if he was trying to find clues to some hidden treasure. His moves reminded me of the radars atop ships, which keep on rotating all around. I followed direction of his sight. He was looking at the webs.

“Why don’t you clean those webs?” Finally he came up with a question after studying webs in detail. Uncle had come to meet my parents and they were not at home. So I was obliged to sit with him and observe him, while he was observing webs.

I never expected that question. I kept looking at uncle trying to formulate a reply to that question. I was looking at him and wondering why is he looking at the ceiling in the first place. I hated all those uncles who asked me about my studies. Asking about webs was a new ball game altogether. While I was still trying to clean webs from my brain so that I could reply, he got up and left.

That is when I realised how many unwanted guests we have at home.

No, don’t get me wrong. I am not talking about uncles who needlessly needle me about my studies, jobs and health, but I am talking about pests, insects and other creatures living in our homes.

Not that I had not been cleaning webs in the house. It was not a very enthralling activity.

One had to look up to clean webs and many a times stingy things fell into the eyes.

Sometimes spiders fell down and one had to stand on sofa for it to run up a wall to spin another web.

We have been fighting mosquitoes ever since we lost our cover of fur during evolution from monkeys. If you look at them carefully, they resemble the versatile apache helicopters. They must be having night vision glasses. They come and land on skin, suck blood and deposit deadly malaria. This much is silent operation and focus is on feeding. For entertainment, they buzz the ears of person who is sleeping and then enjoy the involuntary dance of flaying arms. After they got bored with carrying malaria, they started bootlegging dengue. Another deadly armament added to miniature apaches.

One day I was visiting an uncle who was very methodical. He was cleaning his room cooler for the upcoming summers. He removed the padding of the cooler and I saw few little white balls. Methodical that he was, I was impressed that he keeps naphthalene balls in his cooler.

That was, until one ball dropped and broke. It was an egg. Uncle let out one big expletive in honour of lizards. Lizards are creepy things. I always wonder where they come from. It is as if they grow from walls. And when the eggs hatch, there are so many tiny lizards running around, that the house becomes mini Jurassic Park. Most distressing is the sight of a lizard on ceiling right above you, when you are lying in bed. It is not the animal itself that induces fright in you, it is the thought of it falling on you. Sometimes the tail detaches itself from the body and keeps wriggling for some time. You are left in agony while the lizard merrily grows a new wavy tail.

Ants. Not as menacing as mosquitoes or lizards, they are disciplined soldiers, moving in lines. It is always fun and amazing to follow their line from the food, to somewhere behind the wall. I guess they make a line all the way so that they don’t get lost. I experimented a lot to prove my theory. My favourite was to wipe away few inches of the line in the middle.

Ants on either end would start moving in every direction. It always made sense to start destroying them from the food end to wall end. That way you could succeed without ants running hither and thither. Start from the wrong end and you will end up sweeping larger area with ants escaping in all directions.

Dear uncles, you are not unwanted guests. Just don’t ask the kids in the house about their studies or webs in the corners.
