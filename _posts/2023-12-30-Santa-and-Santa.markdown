X-mas added confusion to my life.

I was schooled and brought up in a rural setting of Punjab in 1970s. The only Santa I knew was Santa Singh of Santa and Banta duo. We were fed on the jokes and banters centered around Santa and Banta Singh. Every joke started with – “Sant and Banta went to………..”.

It was when we moved to a city and I joined college that someone mentioned Santa Claus.

“Santa, you mean.” I tried to correct the person.

Pronunciation of my Santa was quite different from his Santa.

“Santa, I mean.” He tried to correct me.

“Santa Singh, of Banta Singh fame?” I was so sure of myself.

“No, Santa Claus.” He rectified me. And confused me.

I went to a wise man with whom I could share my stupid moments and asked him about Santa Claus.

What he told me confused me further.

Hang a sock by your bed and you will get gifts.

What?

To me, socks are meant for inserting feet and not gifts.

With my kind of schooling, it was considered offensive to the collective nose-dom of the society to take off shoes only, and expose the air to sock-ly pollution. I guess maybe that is the reason Santa never visited this side of the world.

I would like to hang a bag instead, to receive more and bigger gifts. I don’t think Santa could stuff my favorite girl of the class in a sock as my gift.

Then came the reindeer. In villages, we had plenty of exposure to dogs and cows and bulls. We were taught about deer in alphabet books and a few national birds and animals. But reindeer?

The wise man tried to make me understand – “When you rein in a deer, it becomes reindeer.”

Now I could understand. So many husbands could be called rein-husbands.

Reindeer operate in cold weather only. That could be another reason why Santa Claus could not visit me and other children in the rural hinterland of Punjab. He will have to use dogs or cows or bulls, but none of them have any traffic sense. For most of them, middle of the road is the resting place. And who will save Santa Claus from the bulls when he comes wearing red dress?

Then wise man told me about special post offices where all the request letters to Santa are sent and replied to also. Well, that seems farfetched for our country where even the most important mails are lost or delivered late. And to bank upon their own inefficiencies, our postal department developed a system where the customer has to pay more, for sure and timely delivery of the letter. It is called registered post or under certificate post.

And then Santa travels by a sleigh. It has no wheels. I cant imagine a sleigh travelling on our roads full of potholes. Department of roads builds beautiful roads. Then come the departments of sewerage or telecommunication to lay the pipes or wires by digging the road. There is no department of road repairs after the digging.

All said and done, it is futile for children of India to wait for Santa Claus.

Santa Banta jokes can keep them happy.

And for gifts, parents can continue to play Santa Claus.
