“Baba Ji Ki Jai Ho – Long Live the Great Man.”

The atmosphere was reverberating with the slogans of admiration and awe. At the center of the overflowing adulation was an old man with flowing hair and beard. He was wrapped in a simple single cloth and was without any footwear. I am sure there was no need of the single cloth also, but then people would not be looking at his peaceful face.

I was new to the scene.

“Who is this man?” I asked my friend.

“He is a great man. He has denounced everything worldly and lives the simplest of lives. He is an enlightened soul and all the rich and political people are his followers and wish to attain peace.” I was informed.

The guy had more following than top leaders of the country. His number of followers was even more than that of the heroines who had adopted at least one of his traits and wore minimal clothes.

I started looking for more great men. There is no dearth of such men in India. They all had one thing in common. They lived an unpretentious life. Simple living, simple food and simple thought process. And people followed them to the extent of stalking, to learn the art of simplicity and path to salvation.

Darwin described the track of evolution, but not the exact place. Given the fact that the man evolved from monkey, changeover must have taken place in the jungles and other wild places. Imagine the man waking up one day and looking at his reflection in the water – “Oh God, thank you. I am a man now and no longer a monkey.” He looked at monkey in a mocking style.

Monkey laughed at him, a prophetic laughter.

Then he looked down – “Oh my God, I am so naked.” So he started with leaves to cover his nakedness. Fashion at that time meant different types of leaves on different days.

Sitting idle and eating fruit, man was amused by the kernel of fruit rolling down the slope. With so much time at hand and nothing better to do, he invented wheel. Revolving wheel revolutionized the life of man. He used it to transport his food and then himself. Then he used other animals to pull the wheels and later mounted engines on it to make vehicles.

Rubbing things together to pass his time in jungles, the man discovered fire. This he used to cook his food and keep warm. Later it was used to burn down the dwellings of others and then developed it into fire spewing weapons to destroy the humans by the hundreds.

And then someone invented money. It was then that the shit hit the fan. (Fan is the aerial version of wheel invented earlier). Money turned out to be the biggest dividing factor. Have nots and haves. Below the poverty line, poor, middle class – upper and lower, rich, ultra rich, richest – spectrum and the divide is expanding by the day.

In the midst of all this so called development, humans started feeling suffocated and started looking for salvation.

Come to think of it. Humans were created great. Their mental peace was robbed by self-created disparities and inventions. After plundering the planet for many millennia, they re-seek the peace by denouncing what they created through generations.

Help them all, O Great Man, show them the path.

Meanwhile, Monkey is still laughing at the man.
