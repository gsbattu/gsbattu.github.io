After 27 years of being a father, it is for the first time that I am looking forward to Fathers’ Day. I guess my kids are grown up enough to understand that I expect a gift this year. And to make sure that they understood, I told them so very clearly.

I am of the opinion that such days – Valentine, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day and so on, are being propagated by the card, gift and cake industries. Very soon we will run out of the calendar days and it will be celebrations every day of the year. Marriage Anniversary should be taken out of the celebration list.

I don’t know how everyone can have Father’s Day on the same day. It should be celebrated individually on the day when the seeds of fatherhood were sown. On second thoughts, every father then will have multiple days to celebrate depending on the number of children. Thus, it is better to have one universal Father’s Day. One can also celebrate it for the kids one has sired but cannot claim publicly.

Kids are thankful to their fathers for a day, at least. Fathers are thankful to mothers for helping them become fathers. Many a times mothers are not thankful to the fathers for the act. Fathers become father out of pleasure and mothers have to bear for nine months to make the man a father.

Fathers spend lots of time, energy and money on their kids. Moms generally do not agree with this claim. But going by that claim, I suggested to celebrate one hour everyday as Fathers Hour, instead of the yearly ritual. Let the father feel special during that one hour of the day at least. The suggestion was nipped in the bud by the mom and kids at home.

“What do you want for Father’s Day?” I was asked.

“Love and respect.” I replied.

“We are talking about gift only”. Was made clear to me.

One is husband till there is no kid. With kid, one becomes father. Husband part gets over. Wife becomes a mom and is full time dedicated to the kid. Being a father is a thankless job. There always is some unspoken nexus between mom and kids. No amount of bribe can win the kids over.

Kids sometimes try to please their fathers by writing essays on their fathers and posting them on social media on Father’s Day. And they tend to go overboard with the perceived or the imagined qualities of the man. This happened with one of our friends. And we all were so amused to learn about so many qualities of our friend that we had missed to notice since childhood. Discussion went something like this –

“Are the kids talking about this friend of ours?”

“He is not that great, we all know him.”

“May be its an English project given by the teacher.”

“Can it be some other fellow with the same name?”

“We should not be saying this, but may be the mom has introduced someone else as father to the kids.”

Anyways, it is nice to be acknowledged as a good father, at least once a year.

As for my gift for the day? A crate of beer will keep me happy for a week.
