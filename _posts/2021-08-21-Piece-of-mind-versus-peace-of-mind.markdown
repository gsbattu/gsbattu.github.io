“I have this very irritating colleague at office.” The friend said.

“You should learn to ignore him.” I advised from my experience.

“That is what I been doing till now. But today it spilled over, and I gave him a piece of my mind.” He announced with a sense of achievement.

“So how much is left with you?” I asked.

“What how much is left with me?” he needed clarification.

“How much of your mind is left with you after giving him a piece of your mind?” I rephrased my query.

His expressions told me he was about to give me a piece of his mind. I hurriedly excused myself from the situation.

My earliest experience of being at the wrong end of the barrel started at home only. My mother was very generous at giving people a piece of her mind. No prudence, no excuses. If she wanted to do it, she would do it.

I was always left wondering how many pieces are there to a mind.

May be it is like an account. If I give someone a piece of my mind, I lose some mind. If someone gives me a piece of his or her mind, I gain some mind. It is difficult to fathom these mysterious mind games. Sometimes I make timely retreat from a developing situation. The other person, all charged up, gives a piece of mind in my absence. I don’t know what happens to that piece of mind, since I do not receive it.

But that can again lead to utter chaos. What happens if a man gets too many pieces of female minds? Will that affect the working of mind and body of the bearer? It is really confusing. I mean, if there is a lousy husband and he gets too many pieces of his wife’s mind, will he finally start behaving like her?

Eureka!!!!!! That actually might explain why so many husbands start behaving like their wives.

Or a woman gets too many pieces of male minds? Oh ok. That doesn’t happen.

And when people say, “I don’t mind,” may be they are left with no mind. They gave others so many pieces of their mind, they don’t mind anymore.

Come to think of it, how is mind related to heart or brain? It can be an independent entity or a mixture of heart and brain. To me it seems like combination of logic of brain with a sprinkle of emotional quotient.

All the sages spent their lifetime taming their minds. Tame your mind and you tame your emotions and behaviour. And those who could achieve the feat, were so much at peace, they did not feel like sharing the secret.

So here is my own little analysis.

It can be either piece of mind or peace of mind. Opt for the right one – peace of mind. This perpetual give and take of pieces of mind, makes sure no one rests in peace even after giving a piece of mind. The piece of mind that you give to someone, will one day come back to you from some other source.

Mind is still a puzzle to the scientists. And it might turn out to be a jigsaw puzzle. Guys, don’t give away pieces of your mind, that will only spoil the layout of this beautiful canvas of mind. Ugly holes in an enchanting piece of art.

So what is more important, piece of mind or peace of mind? Piece of mind can never achieve peace of mind, that is just an ego inflator. Let go of that, only then peace can percolate in.

I have witnessed many situations where wives are giving the husbands, piece of their mind. And the husband is like, “Hey, give me some peace of mind.”
