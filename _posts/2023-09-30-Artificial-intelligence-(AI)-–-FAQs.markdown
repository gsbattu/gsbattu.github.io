Q: What was the need of artificial intelligence?

A: Out of millions of human beings, only Newton wondered why the apple falls to the ground. Rest of the population was busy blaming each other for everything that had fallen and broken. That is the level of prevalence of intelligence in humans. From viruses on the smallest scale to the universe on the largest scale, humans are unable to decipher the mysteries. Marriage, love, war, visa, lottery, IQ – everything is beyond human understanding. That’s why artificial intelligence was needed.

Q: Is artificial intelligence really artificial?

A: It is called artificial, since it does not grow in the human brain. Just like artificial eye lashes and nails. That actually is the human ego – anything that is not produced by the human body and is used to enhance the form, is labelled artificial.

Q: Is artificial intelligence really intelligent?

A: Apparently, yes. The only limiting factor is the intelligence of the human being who is developing artificial intelligence. Afterall, we can expect intelligent output from an intelligent input only. AI developed by naturally intelligent Einstein will definitely be better than AI produced by a politician.

Q: Who all need artificial intelligence?

A: All, except those who invented fire and wheel. Even Newton and Einstein proposed theories and the rest of the world is busy proving them right or wrong. Measuring speed of electricity is intelligent, but not able to provide every human being with electricity connection is not intelligent. Inventing money was intelligent, but handing over 90% of money to 10% of the population is definitely not intelligent. Electing leaders is intelligent, but letting only the corrupt contest the elections is not intelligent.

Q: Where will we get artificial intelligence?

A: Like everything else on the earth, artificial intelligence will be up for sale very soon. Amazon, Costco, local retailers, barber shops, duty free shops – all will be selling artificial intelligence. But minimum intelligence will be required to recognize real artificial intelligence from fake artificial intelligence. Scamsters have always been more intelligent.

Q: Will it help me reduce the fights with my spouse?

A: Intelligent people don’t marry. So you definitely need AI. Yes, it will guide you when to keep quiet and how not to react. But if your spouse has acquired a better version of AI, she will get to know what you are thinking and then there will be no escape. This suggestion is based on the AI induced input that this question is raised by a husband.

Q: Will my child score more in his exams if I get artificial intelligence for him?

A: This speaks of parental concern and lack of intelligence. You will be able to buy AI related to any profession. You can get AI chip that is preloaded with all information related to medicine or engineering or architecture or any other career. Those equivalent to top institutions or foreign colleges will cost more. So no need to appear for exams, just get government approved professional AI and the child is good to go.

Q: Do I need AI?

A: That is a tricky question. Once one decides that one needs AI, it means one is intelligent enough and doesn’t need AI. One who needs AI, is not intelligent enough to realise the need. That is Catch 23.
