I hated going to school.
More than that, I hated coming back home.
And most of all, I hated the homework.

I hated going to school because it was violation of my right to freedom. How can a government have a policy of schooling a kid who is still in a single-digit age? And how can parents send such a gullible little kid to school? I was not capable of carrying my bag or walking or cycling to school, I was at risk of getting lost. Still, I was made to go to school.

Every day.

Well almost.

At that age, I did not know what patriotism was, but I was so happy for 26th Jan and 15th Aug. Thankfully, no school on those days.

I hated coming back from school. Mom would check tiffin and whether all my belongings were back or not. Unfinished food, missing hanky or missing items from geometry box would lead to full spectrum of emotions. Dad would check all the books and notebooks. Any torn pages or notes from teacher were ominous findings.

And then there was homework. That was sadism of third degree. I mean, I went to school, spent the stipulated hours there, did whatever the teachers told me to do, so why the homework? School is meant for studying and homes are meant for other things. Why burden my home time with school work? Lets look at it from the other angle. If I am not supposed to carry to school, work related to home, then why am I made to carry to home, work related to school? Will it be acceptable to school people if my mom handed me pea pods to take out peas when in school? I am sure, no. So why the other way round? But no one understood my logic. And I was handed over the homework every day by the teachers. Double dose on weekends. I expected my parents to at least ponder over my logic, but they also sided with the teachers.

Then the holidays. School holidays mean break from school. I don’t know why teachers could not understand that. Every teacher handed out huge quantum of holiday homework as if that was the only subject I was going to study during holidays. Multiply that by the number of subjects. Perfect recipe to ruin the holidays of an innocent kid. Again, no one listened to my reasoning.

And the latest? Now we have this trend of work from home! Companies want their employees to stay at home during office hours and do the office work from home. Now this is de ja vu. I am reminded of holiday homework of school – stay at home, but do schoolwork. Companies save on utility expenses. Why pay for the tea/coffee of the employee when he or she can have it
at home? Same for AC. And for computer and printer and internet and A4 sheets.

What do the employees say when someone calls them – are they at home or at office?

Now I wonder, was my school futuristic and preparing the students for a trend that would emerge decades later?
