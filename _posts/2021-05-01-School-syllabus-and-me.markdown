I was taught at length, for almost six years, about the structure and functioning of human body in medical college. Half of it made sense to me and helped me become a good doctor. Other half I had to cram, just to clear my exams and obtain degree.

Two years prior to that were spent preparing for admission to medical college. But I still wonder about what all I was taught in my childhood and high school. Was that really relevant?

My earliest tormenters were – tables. I was supposed to learn tables from one to twenty, by heart.

I always started from zero, though I was not aware about Aryabhata at that time. What a great man. He discovered zero and taught the numbers how to commit hara-kiri.

Fed up with your existence? Go, get multiplied with zero.

Tables of zero, one and ten were my favourite. It was okay kinds till 10. But what was the need to learn tables beyond that? And who ever wanted to learn table of nineteen? I went to the teacher with my query. He listened to me with patience.

“Look son. If you buy one litre of milk every day at Rs nineteen per litre, how will you calculate the amount to be paid to the milkman after a month of thirty one days?”

“I don’t need to. I will pay him nineteen rupees every day. Else, I will pay him twenty rupees every day and will have one litre of milk free on the twentieth day.” I said. The teacher made mental calculations.

“You can do that also, but you need to learn the tables to clear your exams.” Teacher replied. So that was the crux.

Then I was introduced to the structure and formation of the parliament. It was impressive. This is the control room of the country. But then I was supposed to remember the differences between state legislature and the parliament with upper and lower houses. I had to remember qualification for someone who wanted to contest elections, voters’ rights and the whole process of elections. All this, when I was under fifteen years of age and the voting age at that time was twenty one years. By the time I was accorded voting rights, I realised no one had taught me how to select the right candidate. It was not explained how the muscle power became integral part of every elections.

Best was, when I went late to exercise my franchise for the local corporation elections. “It is already done sir, you have already cast your vote.” Said the guy after checking the list. I showed him my fingers. “See man, no ink mark.”

“In that case, we will have to inform the police that you somehow managed to erase the ink mark and have come back to cast the vote second time.” God bless the democracy.

I still wonder why I was taught geometry. I was told how to calculate length of third side of a right angled triangle if the same was known for the other two sides. I always wondered, if someone told the length of two sides why will he not tell the same for third side?

Again I went to the teacher. “Why do we need to find this out?”

He explained, “If you know the height of a wall and the available space at the bottom, you can calculate the length of ladder needed to scale that wall.”

What? I have not seen any thief, electrician or other repair man who have to climb heights, use this calculation. Romeo must have been oblivious to this formula, he used rope ladder to reach Juliet.

Radius of the largest circle that would fit into a triangle. In my real life, I never needed to do that. Nor I needed to fit a square in a circle. The only famous triangle in my young days was the red triangle of family planning. Government was busy trying to fit every family in that triangle.

Less said about Bernoulli’s theorem and Pythagoras theorem, better it is. I really can’t say much because I could never understand. And I swear, I never ever had a use of them in my fifty plus years on this earth. Even today I have to check some book to confirm their spellings. But I had to remember them if I was to clear my exams – pearl of wisdom from my maths teacher.

My appeal to all the policy makers – please don’t burden young kids with the technical knowledge that is of no use in life, except for clearing exams. Time to shift the goalposts to the advantage of the young.
