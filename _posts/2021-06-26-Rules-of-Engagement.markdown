I was about to get married. It was after many rejections and failures at self-match making. I was happy like a butterfly who has just emerged from the cocoon. People were congratulating me and wanted to be part of my celebrations. And I was happy to oblige. One fine evening I was pondering and trying to figure out if I had inadvertently forgot to invite someone.

It was then that it stuck me. All the people who were dancing around me and made me party every evening, were either unmarried or married under one year. Where are the senior and more experienced guys?

So I went to a senior friend. “Hey man. Congratulations, you are getting married.” He said.

“Thanks bro.” I was all smiles. “Been missing you in celebrations.”

“Never mind, will be there for the big event.” He thumbs-up-ed me. “Marriage is a tricky thing. It is like handing over a jet to an untrained pilot. There must be some training by simulation.” He made the statement very casually.

I could read a deeper meaning to that. “Can you please explain.”

“You have to be hammered for a successful marriage.” He commented nonchalantly.

That sounded violent to me. I retracted back in my seat.

“We friends have devised a manifesto for that.” He said.

Manifesto for hammering? – I wondered. I should not have complained to him about not coming for celebrations.

“We call it HAMMER.” He continued. “Happy And Mushy Marriage – Engagement Rules.”

“Wows.” Finally I could speak. I could see that experience matters. “Can you please elaborate.”

“Ya sure.” He said. “There are points for him and for her.”

I was all ears and ready to be HAMMER-ed.

“Points for him to remember:

Sounds very doable. I was actually feeling encouraged. I nodded my head in agreement and he continued.

“Points for her to remember:

Common points

Wows, man. So simple. Be HAMMER-ed and have a happy married life. Amen.
