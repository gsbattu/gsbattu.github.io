“Whose mask is that?” Wife asked as she sat in my car. She was pointing to a mask lying on the floor. And it had lipstick marks on it.

My eyes were ready to pop out of the sockets. Heart was already galloping in an unnatural rhythm. Brain went on a strike, while I was trying to figure out who left the mask behind.

I really did not know. But could I get away with that explanation?

Welcome to the collateral damages of covid protocols.

In the last one year, I have waived at many people who were not the persons I thought them to be. That made me realize that many unrelated persons can have the same body shape and body language.

Similarly many people waved at me and I was at a loss to make out who it was.

I have this knack of popping bad jokes at people and love to see their disgusted expressions. Masks have deprived me of that pleasure.

We had such a reverence for masked people in our childhood. They were our stars. Spiderman, Batman, Batgirl, Flash, Phantom, Zorro. Few of them revealed their faces, others did not.

Then emerged the villains in masks. They would wear funny masks and carry out heists.

We never thought this mask thing was scalable. Covid proved us wrong and surrounded us with people wearing masks. Now we have heroes, villains and ordinary people in masks.

Masks are here to stay. Slowly and slowly it is becoming a fashion accessory too. Gone are the days of mundane green masks. We now have designer masks from all the brands.

One can choose the type of appearance to get by wearing a mask. There are typical ‘medical look’ masks which are usually used by staff in hospitals. There are masks that provide a duck like projection. There are broad masks for a robber look. I am sure, Sheikhs in Dubai must be using gold embroidered masks.

Soon we will have masks with different emojis to let people know the mood of the wearer. Mask with a smile can be very useful, one will not have to keep smiling behind the mask. Girls can wear masks with perfectly shaped lips and nose printed on them. They can apply lipstick on the lip area printed on the mask. May be a nose pin can also be added. Men can have their actual moustache and beard style printed on the mask.

Masks with changing design cannot be far away. Connected with a Bluetooth device, the owner will be able to change the display. From smile to frown, to a pout for a selfie. The mask will become transparent for few moments at the click of button, for the benefit of a favored one.

There will be perfumes for masks. We will feel as if we are roaming in a garden full of roses. No need to cover nose or hold breath while using public toilets. Zipped or buttoned openings can be created for eating, drinking, smoking or picking nose. I can have a pocket on the inside of the mask and keep popcorns there.

The future belongs to the mask industry. There will be customized masks, made on demand.

It will be a costly affair for Ravana. He will be looking for ‘buy five, get ten’ offer.

“Whose mask is that?” Wife had asked and had propelled my heart and thought process to the orbit. I was fiddling with the car keys and gears, trying to get hold of the situation.

“Oh I remember,” she continued after one agonizing minute, “I left it in the car when I took the car to market yesterday.”

It took my heart ten minutes to settle down to a regular rhythm.
