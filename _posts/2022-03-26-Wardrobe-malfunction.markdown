We expect malfunction from things that are mechanical or electrical. But sometimes things as basic as fabric and the accessories added to enhance the beauty or functionality, malfunction. They are important because they cover the assets of the celebrities. Rich and famous are always on lifestyle channels or pics on page 3. Imagine someone famous enjoying a party and suddenly one important strap gives in. It can lead to mass frenzy displayed by collective ‘Oooooooooohhhhh’, giggles, ogling eyes depending upon the exposed part and craning necks of those who missed the action.

General population like me and my peers also suffered many wardrobe malfunctions but they make no news.

Open trouser zip is most common and most embarrassing malfunction or missed function. It can happen at the beginning of the day when one dresses up and leaves home for office. Or it can happen any time during the day after one visits the loo. If it happens to a friend, one jokingly tells the person to zip up. If it happens to the boss at the office, rather than informing him, one rushes to spread the news in the office.

Trouser zip can play truant in many ways. Once in a while it gets stuck in the ‘closed’ position. Slider of the zip refuses to move. The situation becomes critical when one has gone to the loo. It is worse than finding the loo occupied. So one is inside the loo, safety latch of door in place and the zip refuses to budge. It is a battle of wits between how long one can control the tide and how soon can one make the zip move.

A rare but more embarrassing trouser malfunction is when the stitches at the bottom give way. Happens with chubby people who like to wear tight pants or if the pants become tight. Usual precursor to the malfunction is necessity to sit on ground, out of some compulsion or some silly urge. It is the typical sound that announces the malfunction to the wearer as well as those in the audible range. Worst was when it happened to a suitor when he knelt on his knee to propose to the love of his life.

Trouser pocket holes are malfunction that is not visible to the general public. One realises it only when things that are valuable or hard currency is lost through these holes. Many a keys, many a coins have fallen through. It is heartbreaking for a kid is when some eatables are lost. Some unscrupulous elements keep these holes to scratch the areas which otherwise would look uncivil.

Innocent malfunction with shirt buttons happened in childhood especially with school dress. Lot many times, buttons were done in wrong holes, one up or one lower than the right one. It would take a mother or a teacher to notice and set it right. Class fellows are there just to laugh at it.

A pot belly causes gaping between the buttons. If the guy is not wearing a vest, visible belly button and the hairy skin is not a pleasant sight. It is better to sit on the side of such a person. As long as wardrobe is there, it is bound to malfunction. Fig leaves of cavemen never malfunctioned.
