I was born with lots of hair over my head.

Okay, it was no challenge to Rapunzel. But still, lot many.

They were supposed to grow with me. But somewhere down the journey of life, I outgrew my hair. It was as if they got buried in my scalp.

Then the scam began. I told the barber that he should charge me less for having to work on less hair. “No sir, actually I have to work harder on you – first I have to find hair and then cut them.” He replied. Maybe I was not the first person to raise that issue with him.

Not only he charged me the same amount for less hair, he started selling me various oils and magic potions which supposedly would restore my lost crowning glory. When there were no results to show, he would sell me a costlier one. For the last one, he advised me to wear gloves while applying it on my scalp, lest hair grow on my finger tips and palms.

My wife said – “Look what your mother did to you, you lost so many hair.”

My mother said – “Look what your wife has done to you.”

I told my friends – “God was offering either hair or wisdom, I chose wisdom. Oh, I see, you chose hair.”

May be the loss is due to high male hormones. That actually means I am a superman. If one has no hair on the head, there is no need to wear underpants over the trousers to show the world that one is superman.

I have so many friends who complain of bad hair days. And I am like – “What is bad hair day? I am so lucky, I never had that!”

I have saved so much money being in no need of shampoos, I have been guaranteed life long supply of chilled beer. That is damn good trade off.

The situation makes sure I am closer to nature. When the rain drop that is formed miles up in the air, drifts downwards towards the earth through the mystical layers of air and lands on my head, I experience the true music. The percussion notes that are created and conveyed to my brain, are like symphony of the nature. Symphony gets noisier and unbearable when hailstorm accompanies the rain. Then it is time to run to a shelter.

We are so obsessed with hair. Though no government admits it, Indian economy runs on hair related industries. There are have-s and have-not-s. Those who have hair, spend time and money on shampoos, conditioners, fancy haircuts, dyes, streaks, colors and what not. Those who don’t have hair, spend time and money trying to get them back.

It is like business model of YouTube. If you choose to see the advertisements, advertisers pay the YouTube. If you don’t want to see the advertisements, you pay to the channel. Maybe, YouTube learnt the trick from Indian hair industry.

So guys, enjoy the hair while they are here. You will learn to enjoy more once they are gone!
