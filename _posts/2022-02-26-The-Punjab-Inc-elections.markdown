Mr Hand and Mr Weighing Scales have been holding the top post in the company for most of the time, since creation of the company. They have been doing it mostly on turn wise basis. The adult shareholders of the company have the voting rights. This time, Mr Broom and Mr Lotus also joined the race for the top post. They all individually appealed to the shareholders to cast their vote in their favour.

They tried to make an impression on the shareholders through some common methods and also by bashing others.

Common methods:

They also made individual appeals.

Mr Broom – I will bring sweeping changes in the company and will make sure it has a clean image. Corruption and drugs will be wiped out. Mr Hand portrays himself to be patriotic but represents a foreign hand actually. Mr Lotus will make a pond out of the company. Mr W Scales has always thrown its weight behind the corrupt.

Mr Hand – lets join hands and make the company strong. A company in hand is better than two in pond or weighing scales. Mr Broom can only sweep the floors or take the cobwebs off the walls, it cannot make the company shine. Mr Lotus might seem like a flower above the surface, but has a very thorny stem. Mr W Scales is tilted the wrong way.

Mr Lotus – whatever the surroundings, a lotus shall always shine. Similarly, I will make the company shine whatever the environment be. I used to work with Mr W Scales earlier, but he decided to work alone to appease some of you. Mr Broom has failed to clean the garbage of the company he originated from. Let’s wave goodbye to Mr Hand.

Mr W Scales – I represent equality and justice. Mr Lotus was being harsh on some of you, so I have parted ways with him. Mr Hand has used the company for the benefit of his own family for many generations. Mr Broom is a misguided implement and is always related to dirt.

And now that the exercise is over, they all were sitting together and enjoying their drink.

Mr Lotus addressed Mr W Scales, “We parted ways just to win over the public. We can join forces again after the results, if need be.”

Mr W Scales replied, “Of course. Anything to keep control of the company and to keep Mr Hand and Mr Broom out.”

Mr Hand said, “No problem, just make sure me and my men are taken care of. We will do the same for you when we get control of the company.”

Mr Broom also pitched in. “I am new in the business, treat me like a younger brother. I shall serve you well when you grow old.”

They all raised a toast to each other. Cheers.
