America is having a serious issue with guns. Random shooting sprees are becoming endemic. Any random guy gets hold of a random gun, picks a random location and kills random people.
The senate goes into a huddle and decides it is time to bite the bullet. Rumblings of gun control are initiated. And are very efficiently shot down by the gun lobby.

Scene is different in India. In my five-decade plus life, I have not seen more than five guns. As such I don’t feel threatened by the guns and I don’t know how I will react if I ever happen to look down the barrel of a gun. These days I am mortally afraid of mobile users. I feel surrounded by mobile users who seem to be on a suicidal mission and I definitely don’t want to perish as collateral damage.
Morning walk used to be the perfect way to start the day. Only danger was some stray dog in a biting mood. If one follows the same route every day, dogs become friendly and one also gets to know the nature of various dogs at various spots. Latest threat is two wheeler users, who drive on the edge of the road, quite close to the area where walkers are supposed to be. Earlier it was two wheeler drivers who would tuck the phone between shoulder and the ear and talk while driving. Now they have progressed to driving with one hand and reading or typing messages with the other hand. I retreat to the farthest point whenever I see such a driver. I don’t want to be the subject of the guy’s next message – “Oh I just ran over a morning walker, why can’t people just stay home and use a treadmill.” Number of such drivers is now more than the number of dogs on the way.

While commuting to work, there is hardly any car driver who is not on phone. Drivers of other vehicles talking on phone, now feel to be much safer than the drivers who are trying to read message or email, or punch in a location on maps and posing a serious threat to my life. So much so, one can tell from the movement pattern of the car that the driver is on phone and is not much concerned about the vehicles around him. I am not sure how can I avoid being martyred by such drivers on the highways.

Then there are people using staircase in my office building. They are looking at the screens of their phones while climbing up or down. I have to keep an eye on them lest they miss a step and tumble down the stairs and I get an unceremonial burial under them.

Then I have heard people getting killed because of wrong kind of messages on their phones. Such messages can range from being fanatic to romantic.

For me FOMO has a new meaning – Fear of Mobiles.
FOMU to be precise – Fear of Mobile Users.

Can I sue the mobile companies for all the threats to my life?
Or just like gun lobby, they will also say – “Mobiles don’t kill people, people kill people.”
