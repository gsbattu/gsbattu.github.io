Ding dong.

It is the doorbell. Everyone in the house looks at each other.

It has been rainy and cold days ever since the beginning of the year. Washed clothes take days to dry in such weather. Washing of the clothes cannot be delayed beyond a certain time. And brunt is borne by every furniture in the house where the clothes are spread to dry during rains or at night. A ringing doorbell is the nightmare at such moments. The guy at the door wants to rush in to avoid rain and cold. The guy at home is in rush to collect all the wet clothes spread all over the rooms before opening the door. Pet lovers like us who have dogs at home get a legitimate excuse to delay the door opening. “Let me put the dog on leash.” We shout in the direction of the door

“You are being warned.” Said the announcement on TV.

I wondered we are being warned about what.

I did not have to wait for long. The next line was topic of the warning.

“Human activities and misadventures are leading to global warming.”

Global warming?  Talk to me about the cold wave that we are facing since the beginning of the year.

I wanted to hear, “You are being warmed.”

Two third of January has gone by and there is no trace of the Sun. Add rain and winds to that and we have a severe cold wave at our hands. It is so cold, one has to have tea straight from the pot if one wants it hot.

“Layers”. This is the advice from our prosperous friends from abroad who live in inches of snow. “Wear many layers of clothes and you will be warm.”

So I wore many layers of clothes. Four, to be precise. Before warmth, came the feeling of a stuffed toy. I had this feeling as if I am the stuffed teddy bear of the house. Or as if I am wearing a space suit and am ready for a space-walk. I opened the door of the house and stepped out as if I am stepping out of the space station to make some repair on the solar panel. One step out and the cold wind pushed me two steps back in the house. Once back in, I tried to do the routine chores like picking up cup of tea or putting it back, bending over to check something on the floor or things like that. Layers had reduced the bending capacity of every joint by half.

I had to reduce the number of layers to un-stuff myself.

“Where is the Sun? we need our quota of vitamin D.” chanted my bones.

“Keep quiet. At least we are keeping you wrapped and warm.” Replied skin and flesh.

“The toilet seat feels so cold.” I was discussing the weather with a friend.

“There is a simple solution to that. Either visit the loo immediately after someone has used it, you will find the seat warm and welcoming, else sit on it fully clothed and let it warm up before you lower your guard.” He presented me with pearls of wisdom.

There are not many options left about what to do at home in such weather. No one wants to leave bed without any compelling reason. Reading a book or working on laptop is not very attractive option as that entails keeping the hands out of blanket for extended periods. Watching TV has been the most popular wastage of time as one needs to take out the hands only to operate the remote.

Well, in this kind of weather, global warming doesn’t seem to be too bad an option.

Warn me or warm me, give me some sunshine.
