It was early morning. I was humming and watching TV. Infront of me was my first cup of tea with a biscuit. As is the routine, I dipped the biscuit into the tea. Moved it to and fro and took it out to enjoy the dipped biscuit. It was at that moment that I realized I had only half the biscuit in my hand. The dipped half had disappeared in the tea.

What the………. Hell.

It was kind of emotional emergency.

My brain called out – “What do you wanna do, eat the undipped half or use it to salvage the dipped half?”

In that split second, I decided to use the undipped half to scoop out the lost half. The decision was not based on any scientific knowledge. It also over looked the fact that the remaining half could meet the same fate.

So I dipped the other half of biscuit deep into the cup and tried to retrieve the fallen half. Very soon I had to let it go because the tea was too hot for my fingertips. Now I had one cup of hot tea with two halves of biscuits at its bottom.

Even though it itself had made the decision, the brain called out- “That was stupid.”

“No it was not stupid, rash maybe. Never mind, a spoon can always do the trick of bringing out the biscuit.” I replied.

So I tried to recover the lost treasure with the help of a spoon. Biscuit came out more in the form of runny dough. What I could recover was just a small portion, rest got kind of dissolved in the tea.

Now I had a portion of dissolved biscuit that tasted like tea and a cup of tea that tasted like biscuit. Both ruined.

The episode me curious about the tea and the biscuits.

I learned that tea was discovered or invented in China and it spread to rest of the world including India. And when it came to India, first thing we did was to add adrak to it. Not only that, we coined an idiom to the effect that monkeys don’t know the taste of adrak.

Two queries still remain unanswered:

What’s tea got to do with adrak?

Why don’t the monkeys know the taste of adrak?

And biscuits, they were baked first time somewhere in Europe. Like tea, they also spread all over the world and reached India also. When biscuits came to India, first thing we did was to dip them in the tea.

We Indians know how to mix and mess up.

May be one day someone file a case in consumer court over sinking biscuits.

May be biscuit companies will start printing “how long to dip this biscuit in tea” instructions on their packing.

Till then, advice from a veteran, eat half the biscuit that remains in your hand. Let the sunken half rest at the bottom of the cup, like Titanic it is not to be explored. And enjoy the tea sipping gently till you reach the drowned half.
