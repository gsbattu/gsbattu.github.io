I heard a shriek.

“What happened?” I asked as I reached the site of commotion.

“There is a lizard.” The wife replied.

“And who shrieked, you or the lizard?” I just asked while analysing the situation.

Next shriek was mine. Being stomped by a pencil heel can be painful.

Lizard was looking at us amused. It had never seen wife and husband screaming in sequence.

“You should have used that heel on the lizard.” I told my wife while nursing my foot.

Lizard heard that and disappeared behind the false ceiling.

Then began the operation lizard.

I remember there was none when the house was built. And I am sure, no disgruntled relative or friend of mine smuggled them in. It can be a yucky feeling carrying a lizard in the pocket. Carrying a knife can be better option. But come to think of it, lizards can unleash life long screaming agony on the host.

Our pet labrador was sitting right next to me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I looked at the lizard. He followed my gaze.

“Sorry boss. Cats and thieves are my responsibility, not the lizards.” He said.

I presented the problem to my friends.

“I was told its best to hit a lizard with a broom. When I did that, half the lizard fell down and started dancing and the other half ran away. It was after some jumping around, that I realized dancing half was the tail and the real half had escaped. When the dance stopped after some time, I had to pick the lifeless tail and throw it away. And few days later the real half reappeared with a designer tail.” One of my friends shared his experience.

As luck would have it, there was an ad in the local newspaper about a man who could perform miracles and solve all the problems.

I went to him.

“Baba ji, please help me in getting rid of the lizards at home.” I pleaded with folded hands.

“Why do you want to get rid of them?” he looked me in the eyes.

“My wife dreads them.”

He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and whispered almost inaudibly, “It is easier to get rid of a wife than lizards.” He opened his eyes and said audibly, “Lizards are peaceful animals. Consider them your friends and you shall be happy.”

It seemed there is no escaping from the lizards.

“How many lizards do you have at home?” Another friend asked.

That was an unreasonable question. I don’t know how many are there. They all look the same. So, every time I see one, I don’t know it’s a new one or the same as the one I saw half an hour back. Unless they join the lizard army and all come out marching, walking in neat lines. Only then I can count them.

“You can spray paint them with different colors to identify them and then count them.” He suggested.

“Why do you want me to count them?”

“It is better to kill time than to kill lizards.” He said profoundly.

I am still looking for a way to get rid of lizards.
