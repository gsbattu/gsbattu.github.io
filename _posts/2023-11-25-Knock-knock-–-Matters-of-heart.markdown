“Hello”

I looked around. No one.

“Hello hello”.

Again, no one. So I ignored it.

“Hello………….Hello, Hello, hello…hello”. It was losing its rhythm.

Now I was getting intrigued. I could feel my pulse rising.

Suddenly hello changed to knocking. Someone was knocking. Soon I realized that someone was in my chest. It took me a little less than a second to realise that it was my heart knocking. It was knocking like a car engine totally out of tune. And it was racing like a formula car which had lost its control. Instinctively I put my hand on my pulse. It felt like a staccato in a war zone. Quick bursts interspersed with tense pauses. Only person who could get killed in this war was me.

It was my time to initiate a conversation and say hello to my heart.

“Hello boss” heart replied.

“You are trying to kill your boss.” I reprimanded it.

“No boss. I am dancing.”

“Neither me nor you will survive this dance buddy. What happened to the basic rhythmic moves?” I asked.

“That was so monotonous.”

I wanted to explain that it was not exactly monotonous, but bi-tonous. Lub and Dub. I wanted to have heart to heart talk with my heart. But between the two of us, it was the only heart.

“Why should brain have all the fun?” heart was still dancing.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“When you have coffee, the brain gets the kick. This time I also joined in and see me dance to coffee.” The heart said. “And drinks. You have drinks and that sozzles the brain only. I extracted my share today.”

“I keep all my emotions in you.” I tried to placate the waltzing heart.

“They are painful more frequently than not.” Suddenly the heartbeat became more erratic. I guess emotional talk was a bad move.

Clearly, this was a revolt. The thought of revolt by other organs was petrifying. It would be quite a ruckus if liver, kidneys and spleen also started dancing. I can’t let my body become a discotheque. And if bladder and intestines also join the dance, outcome can be quite messy.

My brain was getting worked up. It was raising questions about the unwarranted dance of the heart and was feeling threatened by decreased blood supply.

Heart was enjoying on its own and was not listening. Instead, it was making lots of noises which I could hear in my chest and ears.

Time to take the case to the medical facility. After admission and intravenous infusions, peace was brokered by the doctor. Heart was nudged into its basic rhythm. Me and my brain heaved sigh of relief and conveyed a heartfelt (literally) thanks to all.

PS – An advice to all the males who visit a hospital in emergency. Clip the hair on your arms and chest. Treatment was soothing, but removing tapes from arms and cardiac patches from the chest at the time of discharge, was soul ripping experience. My salute to all the girls who get the waxing done voluntarily.
