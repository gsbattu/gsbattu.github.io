“My passport validity is about to expire.” I was discussing with my friend.

“You should apply for a new one ASAP, it takes more than three months to get a new passport in routine.” He informed me.

I don’t have that kind of patience. Not that I had to travel internationally very urgently. I am not even very fond of travelling. It is just that I can’t see my nation lag behind in basic services to the citizens. I mean, having a passport is one thing and travelling abroad is something entirely different. My first two passports reached their expiry date without moving out of the cupboard. So I decided to apply under the tatkal scheme.

With all my wisdom, I collected all my papers, fixed an appointment and reached the passport seva kendra. I was told to stand in line in front of the building gate. We Indians have very different definition of standing in a line.  We make multiple lines. They resemble circles more than lines. Then females, always fighting for equality, decide to make a separate line. The exercise is a great leveler. Rich, poor, literate, illiterate, scented, sweaty, all stand there shoulder to shoulder. Unless you know the passport officer, of course.

After the security people had their quota of command over the applicants, we were escorted to the reception area, which again had multiple lines.

“I am the same guy” a senior citizen in front of me was having an argument with the bored girl at the counter. He had gone bald since his last passport and pic in Adhaar.

“No, you must submit an affidavit for change in appearance.” She was adamant.

He had to leave without the job being done.

I submitted my papers.

“We need three IDs, you have only two.” She handed back all my papers.

“Passport is a fundamental right, it should be issued along with Adhaar. Without any expiry.” I quoted the Constitution, modified as per my insight. She was not impressed. Actually, she got irritated.

“Get one bank account passbook with a stamped pic of yours.”

That was tatkal rejection to tatkal passport. I was traveling from other city.

After ten days, I went to the office again with a new bank passbook.

“You don’t have the appointment.” The guard refused to let me in.

“I had an appointment, I had to get a few more documents,” I informed the guard.

“You cannot go in without an appointment.” He informed me.

Another tatkal rejection to tatkal passport.

I made another appointment next week and went to the office, third time. Very proudly I handed over all the documents including the bank passbook.

“Passbook has no entry in it.” She handed back my documents.

“You need it for identification purposes and not for monetary purposes.” I was losing my cool.

She was already attending to the next person, ignoring me and my arguments.

“What do I do now?” I had to ask her.

“There is a bank branch nearby. Go and get the entries printed from there and come back.”

That added one kilometer walk to eighty kilometer drive to the passport office.

Finally, I was ushered into the action area. I was supposed to visit three counters. I was photographed, scanned and fingerprinted at the first counter.

“Now go back and sit in the waiting area.” Another guard instructed me.

“What? I am a tatkal applicant.”

“It is one hour lunch break, tatkal or no tatkal.” The guard was curt.

I learnt a lesson in patience but lost a few percent of my patriotism that day.
