“No, I don’t want it.” Was her terse reply.

That was the first rejection slip that I was witness to. It was a rejection slip for an individual but negated the efforts of whole bunch of friends. One of us took fancy to a girl in the college. After encouragement sessions spread over many beer evenings, we were able to convince him to convey his feelings to the girl.

We all chipped in with our help. A decent looking card with emotional wording was procured from the book shop. More nice words were added manually. Auspicious day and more auspicious time of evening was fixed for the delivery of the card. We were very particular about the evening time so that we could celebrate the conquest over beer.

We went to the girls’ hostel to hand deliver the card. The girl came to the visitors area. The guy went up to the girl, while we waited few steps back.

“I have got something for you.” The guy said.

“No, I don’t want it.” She said and walked away.

Beer we had, but in a very somber mood.

I devised a double edged plan to protect myself from such rejections. One, always send the card through some girl known to you, at least it will be accepted and read. Two, never ask for a reply. No reply would mean no rejection slip.

But I could not escape the rejection slips from learned editors of the newspapers. Those were the days when there were no emails. I would write an article which would seem excellent work of literary art to me. I would be so impressed with myself that I would personally type the article, put it in an envelope and mail to the newspaper. I would start checking the newspaper right from the very next day, knowing well that mail will take at least three days to be delivered. After about one month of newspaper checking, my envelope would come back inserted in another envelope and accompanied by nicely worded regret letter, duly signed by the editor.

Very soon editors got bored of signing rejection slips and stopped doing it. That way they saved the time, paper and postage. I was saved from facing embarrassment. It was awkward whenever family members asked about the content of ‘that’ letter from the newspaper. It really simplified the procedure. Keep checking the newspaper till the article appears or simply get tired of the practice and stop checking.

Rejection slips from scientific journals for research articles are more ruthless. They don’t regret rejecting the articles, they actually enjoy doing it. They make sure that the shortcomings are exaggerated and conveyed back in bold, italic and underlined. They tend to trap their victims by inviting papers for publishing, with the disclaimer that they encourage paper writing.

Maybe every publishing house should have their own, designer rejection slips. Let all feel encouraged to collect different kinds of rejection slips. Students can develop it as a hobby right from junior school. Make rejection slips so attractive that people should feel sad if their article is accepted and published.

“Our child received first rejection slip today, see it is so beautiful.” Let the proud parents announce to the friends.

Once going through my drawer, I cam across few of the poems penned by me during my college days whenever inspired by any girl. The poems still looked cute to me. I thought big. Real big. I made a neat package of all, looked up the address of legendary Khushwant Singh and sent it to him, requesting him to review my poems.

Few days later, I received a postcard from the great man. It read – “I am not the right person to review poems. But rhyming the last words does not make a poem.”

I get your point sir. Maybe my poems were not worth the penny, but they got me the best literary trophy – handwritten postcard from fabled Khushwant Singh.

And I understood why the poems were not effective.
