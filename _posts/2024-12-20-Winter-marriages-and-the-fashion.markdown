North India shivers in winters. It is as if we are on vibratory mode. Display of single digit temperatures on phone screen or TV channels further aggravates the feeling and increases the amplitude of shivers.

Winters is also is season of marriages. Now, that is quite understandable. Marriage is nice to get cozy in a romantic way. Newly married couples will have at least one warm winter. By the next winter there will be something between them that will keep them apart – either a baby or some fight.

Then we have a league of super women who attend these marriages. They are the guests at marriages and the temperature is single digit for them also. But they dress up as if it is peak of summer. Beautiful damsels in beautiful dresses. Single layer of eye catching clothes. Sometimes, even sleeveless or backless. No sweaters, shawls or woolens. Nothing to keep them warm for the night out except for the confidence of looking good and the faith in branded couture.  And of course, heart and body warming appreciative glances of all the men around.

Well, as is expected, all these beautifully attired females tend to flock around heaters or bonfires provided at the venue. And the red glow adds to the glamorous persona of the divas. They look like the prima donna straight out of some fictional movie. They add glitter to the fire.

Men are at the disadvantageous pole. They are overly clothed. That makes their middle bulge even more than the actual diameter. All the heaters and fire points are occupied by the beauties. Only thing that keeps the men warm is a stiff drink. They try to soak through their eyes, the red warm glow coming from the females. But that is over negated by the cold stare of the wives. Stare of the wife is many degrees colder than the warmth of the red glow being reflected from the wonderful ladies.

I wonder if there are centrally heated fashionable female clothes for such occasions. I mean, the ones with batteries and warming pads concealed therein. Marriage venues will then be providing charging points for such dresses.

I hope the females don’t catch cold during their adventurous evenings and live their lives in a normal way during the next few days. I shall ask my ENT and Chest specialist doctor friends if they receive more female patients with cough and cold during the winter marriage season.

I wish to hear a no. Let not the fear of a running nose dampen the adventure of hot fashion.
