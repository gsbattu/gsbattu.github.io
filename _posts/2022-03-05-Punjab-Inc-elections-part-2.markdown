It was relaxation time for all the candidates. Votes had been cast and were resting peacefully in the EVMs. Counting day was still away.

Mr Broom, Mr Hand, Mr Lotus and Mr Weighing Scales were enjoying their drinks together. Publically they had spoken against each other, but were good friends behind the closed doors.

The old guard Mr W Scales addressed others. “Let us prepare the statements for the Winning Candidates (WC) and Losing Candidates (LC). All of us can use those statements depending upon who wins and who does not. We  need  not  waste energies doing the same job individually.”

“Cheers.” All raised a toast to this smart idea. So the following statements were prepared.

LC:   The EVMs had been rigged. When our people went to cast their votes, they pressed the button marked for our candidate, but the indicator light displayed on some other candidate. We had already submitted a request to the election commission about tempered machines. We wanted the process to be carried out with ballot papers. We did not know how to manipulate the machines.

Moreover, while the machines were stored before the counting, the goons went in and voted in favor of the other party.

WC:  Our faith in EVMs has been vindicated. They have projected the real sentiments of the people. The vote count is exact. Machines make no mistakes. Security of the stored machines was fool proof. No fool could enter the building. Only the people who knew how to operate the machines were let in.

LC: There was bogus voting. Votes were cast for the dead and for the people who were not in town. People were carrying fudged voting cards. I can give you list of people who are already dead but have cast their votes.

WC: Only the people who were in the voting list, dead or alive, were allowed to cast their votes. Dead people casting their votes is blessings from the heavens. Rather than criticizing the dead, we should thank them for taking out the time to visit the earth again and taking part in the democratic process. And casting the votes for people who were out of town, speaks volumes about the efforts of the polling staff. The country undertakes the process of voting in right earnest and makes huge preparations. The votes that are not cast, makes the nation appear immature. Thanks to the polling staff for making sure that the efforts of the government do not go waste.

LC: The voters were influenced with money and liquor power. There was free flow of both the things. Poor people got swayed.

WC: We were just letting people know that if we win, we will provide genuine liquor and money to the masses. The other party lost because they provided spurious liquor and counterfeit currency to the voters.

LC: We will continue to raise issues of public interest. We will keep serving the people till next elections. We will expose the wrong doings of the winner. We will not rest in peace.

WC: Thank you people for placing your faith in us. We worked hard and spent much money in the run up to these elections. Now we will rest for some time and see you before next elections.

All the candidates were handed over the print outs of statements.

Now all that we have to do is wait for the results and see which candidates makes which statement.
