I am not fat. I never was.

But I was fed on butter and desi ghee right from my childhood. And now past the middle age, all that stuff has accumulated on the front part of my tummy. It is not much. But it is there. And it is not letting me achieve that lean and mean look.

When I look around, I see lot many middle-aged men with bulging middles. They come in all sizes and shapes. Some are tall and hefty. Others are just hefty. I thought tall men would have less apparent tummy bulge. But then I realised that tall men have a taller tummy bulge.

Position of the belt says a lot about the degree of the paunch and the expertise of the wearer. The first sign of the bulge is a belt that is tilted downwards at front. A belt at the wrong place will always tend to slide downwards and the poor guy will always be pulling his trousers up. Ok, not the poor guy. Poor guys don’t have the resources to develop a paunch. And if the guy is holding something important with both hands, like beer glasses, it can be a critical decision what to let go – the glasses or the trousers.

It takes some time and experimentation to find the most appropriate place for the belt, so that it doesn’t slide down. The two most common positions are either at the most bulging part or just below the bulge. The top position makes the pants look bulky as the whole bulge is contained therein. The lower position lets the pants have a natural shape but makes it difficult for the wearer to look at the belt. If asked – are you wearing a belt or not? –  the guy has to feel the belt with his hands before he can reply.

I was advised many exercises to reduce the tummy fat and develop six pack abs. I did the needful half heartedly and achieved half the results. I am sure I have six pack abs but they are obscured by the chunk of fat in front of them. My only worry right now is- by the time I am successful in losing the fat, the abs might become obscure. I wonder what is better – shapely abs behind the fat or no fat and no abs.

Or maybe I do nothing and keep claiming that I do have well developed abs behind that lump of fat.
