2023 handed over the baton to 2024. Just as decades of one’s life keep on progressing without any chance of a revisit.

Life for boys revolves around parents, friends, girlfriends and health. Every decade, the orientation towards these keeps on changing. Let me walk you through feelings of  progressive decades.

First two decades of life are spent in useless activities like thumb sucking, schooling and entrance exams.

It is in third decade of life, that is in 20s (Bad schooling will make you count 20s as second decade) that one starts to realise that there is more to life than studies.

Age 20-30 years:

Age 30-40 years:

Age 40-50 years:

Age 50-60 years:

You have to wait for a few years to get my views on 60s.
