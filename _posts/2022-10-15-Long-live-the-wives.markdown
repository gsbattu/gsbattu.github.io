My body and psyche is not programmed to fast. The day I try to keep a fast, the day becomes slow. By the time I feel the day should be over, not even a couple of hours are over in actual. On the occasion of very first Karwa after my marriage and still in awe of the holy vows, I volunteered to keep fast in solidarity with my wife. May be my decision was influenced by the fact that the beneficiary of the whole hardship was me only. Going by algebra, my fasting should add to the efforts of fasting by my wife. By noon I realised, rather than adding years to my life, I would not survive the day without eating or drinking. So I decided not to be over greedy for a longer life, had my grub and prayed that fasting by the wife should add adequate years to my life.

After few years, with the kind of husband I proved to be as per parameters of my wife, she also stopped fasting. She was so fed up with me that metamorphically she could never be fasting.

With my own handicap in wise things, there are certain matters that I fail to comprehend and process for a plausible outcome. There are more questions than answers in my biography till date.

Why do men outsource the prayers for their own longevity? Logically it would be the person, male or female, who would be more interested in one’s own long and healthy life than anyone else. No one can guarantee the sincerity or purity of the prayers by someone else. So my advice to all men would be – wish to live long or want to pray for the same? – you are the best person to do it. You should keep the fast. Your prayers for yourself will be without any prejudice and of the purest form.

Another query that I have is – why are prayers for long life of a man required after marriage only? There can be two aspects to this riddle. First can be – a man’s life is under threat after marriage. I did a survey and men admitted to the added risk to life through marriage induced murder, poisoning or high blood pressure. And second – only a wife cares and prays for the husband. Mother also cares about the son, but once the son becomes a husband, the onus shifts onto the wife. And both mother and wife, have different approaches for prolonging the life of the man. A mother cooks and overfeeds the son for him to be healthy. A wife adopts the fasting way.

But for sure, no one can take away the credit of a hard day spent fasting by the wives. Every marriage has its share of discordant notes which can range from one instrument to full orchestra. Despite all the differences, ladies endure the day with a smile for the husbands.

I wonder if the men who do not marry and there is no wife to pray for them, live longer or not as compared to married men with add-on prayers. Bachelors might live longer, but it will be a boring life without a wife. Prayers or no prayers, I am happy to have a wife in my life.
