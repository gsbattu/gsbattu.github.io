New year resolutions are very efficient.

They have a failure rate of hundred percent.

“Good morning, sir. We are calling from University of New Year Resolutions.” I got the call close to the year end.

“Good morning.” I replied cautiously.

“Sir, we are conducting a survey and would like to ask you few questions.”

“But how do I know who you are. Tell me about you and your organisation first.” I was not occupied at the moment and was curious.

“We are a bunch of young entrepreneurs and started this University of New Year Resolutions. We were so sure about its success going by the fact that almost every person makes multiple resolution near the beginning of the year. We call them LIARS (List of Incomplete Avowed Resolutions). The University started various departments that would help every aspirant fulfil their resolutions. We also hired faculty who were expert in new year resolutions.” The guy at the other end sounded sincere.

A university for new year resolutions? The idea seems so unique. They must be doing exceedingly well.

“I am impressed with your concept. And I believe your institute must be buzzing with activity.” I complimented him.

“On the contrary sir, we are unable to enrol students. And we are trying to ascertain the reason behind that. We were planning to open branches all over the world as LIARS are there in every corner of the globe.”

Why should such a brilliant idea based on LIARS not be able to take off? This guy wants to interview me but now I have so many questions that I want to ask him. May be we can have two-way interview.

“Okays you can start your survey with me.” He had the first right as he had initiated this conversation.

“Can you please share your resolutions of last year.” He asked.

I did not have to think long. I have had the same resolutions for the last many years.

“I want to sing a song on stage, wish to run five kilometers and have four girlfriends.” I could recite my resolutions even in sleep. All my friends also know my list, they have heard it so many times over the years.

“How did you decide these wishes?” The guy asked.

The question was so simple. This is what I want to do in life.

“It has been my wish for so long. These are the things that I could never do, so I decided to have them as my new year resolutions.”

“And tell me why you could not do these things till now?” the guy was persistent.

“I guess, I don’t have it in me to sing a song, run five kilometers or have four girlfriends.” That was my candid confession.

“Hmm. What made you think that you will achieve these goals if you park them as your new year resolutions?”

I have no answer to that question.

“Do you enjoy your drinks?” he asked.

I do.

“Were you high when you first decided on this LIAR?” was the next query.

We have been celebrating with gusto, arrival of every new year ever since I remember. Chances of being high while listing new year resolution, were quite high.

“What efforts did you make towards singing a song?”

“I bought a karaoke mic.” I told him.

“How many times did you sing songs in the year?”

“Two or three times may be. My family members don’t let me sing. They are sure I can’t sing.”

“Did you practice running?” second point on my list was under scrutiny.

“I wanted to but I could not, for one reason or the other.” I was sheepish.

“I am sure you must have made at least two girlfriends.” The guy sounded confident.

“Not really……not even one” I was optimistic when I had decided the number, but with every passing year the optimism needs more and more supplements.

“Now I know why our project failed. LIARS are abundant, but people choose targets which they cannot achieve in ordinary circumstances. And half the wishes are made after imbibing liquor. Request to make resolutions that are achievable and over a cup of coffee.”

Okays I will tone down mine list to no song, no running and three girlfriends.

Amen.
