Wows. That is some list. Add my name to the list. The common meeting point? We all are dictated by the same constellation – Aquarius. That should make us equal. That is what I believed when I was born.

“Congratulations. You have been blessed with a son.” The nurse handed me over to my parents. Time and date of birth was noted in the file. “He is an Aquarian and can be president, author, sportsperson, scientist, astronaut or may be an actor.” She might have said. I mean, that can be a possibility.

Date and time and place of birth were conveyed to astrologer of the area. He made a chart with so many rectangles and other shapes.

“He will study till class 9 and will fail in class 10.” Spoke the wise man.

I cleared my 10 th class with good grades. And many more classes in different subjects and in different universities.

I believe, time and place of fertilization of egg might be more important. People find it embarrassing to divulge that information to astrologers.

I went back to the astrologer with my birth chart. “Sir, I have cleared many classes.” I informed him. Not to be browbeaten, he said, “Education does not mean college degrees, O uninitiated one, what I predicted was that your level of wisdom shall remain that of a class 10 fail.” That was a googly. I know, many of my relatives and friends would definitely agree with him.

I was not to give up. “Can you show my where to find Uranus or Venus or Mars in the sky?” I challenged him. “And how do you know their position at the time of my birth?”

“It is a science that a person with a wisdom level of 10 th fail, cannot understand.” He made his point.

“And where did you learn that science?” I was trying to poke a weak point in his façade. “It was passed on to me by my mentor, a great man.” He bowed his head in respect as he mentioned his teacher.

“Did he have a telescope to note the position of planets at the time of birth of a child?” I was adamant.

He refused to reply to my query, declaring my question blasphemous.

I addressed the planets.

“Are you aware of all the births that take place on earth?”

“We are governed by laws of physics and logic, we have nothing to do with the prediction of future of any and every individual being born on earth.” Said the spokes-planet. “I can predict only one thing – with all the havoc being wreaked on climate, earth seems to have bad future.” “You think we decide fate of humans?” Pluto responded. “Look at me. It was humans who changed my fate. I was a planet once, now I am not.”

I addressed Galileo, a fellow Aquarian, and a great explorer of celestial bodies.

“Does the configuration of planets at the time of birth influence the future of the child?” “I guess, not at birth. They changed my fate when I changed the center of the universe from earth to sun. I was put in jail.” He replied.

Those who predict future in the name of planets, have never studied constellations. Those who spent all their lives studying the universe and positioning of planets, never thought of predicting future.

Sometimes I feel the astrologer was right when he announced that my wisdom level shall be that of 10 th fail. I do not understand so many worldly things that everyone else accepts without missing a heartbeat. For example, this astrology thing. Going by the number of zodiac signs, all the population of the world can be divided into twelve groups. And all the persons in one group should have same traits and future. The daily horoscope should hold good for one lakh Aquarians in my city alone. As per my undergrad level of wisdom, all the kids born at one place in the given time period should have same level of education, success and failure, and wealth.

In the meantime, I pray to God to prove me wrong, give me wisdom level of at least a graduate, and give me fame and abilities similar to fellow Aquarians.
