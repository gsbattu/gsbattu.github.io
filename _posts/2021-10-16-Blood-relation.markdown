I was on the night duty in Emergency Room of the hospital associated with the local medical college when a decent looking young chap walked in. It was past midnight and the initial rush was over.

“Sir, I need your help, please.” He said innocently. He was wearing white apron, must be a student at the medical college. His mannerism and body language had already won me over. Help I shall if I can, was already decided.

“Say.” I said to him.

“Sir, I am a student of final year.” He stated.
I waited for him to make his request.

“I went to the lab in the Emergency, sir. I need some blood but the technician on duty refused to part with some. Can you please put in a word and get me few ml of blood?” He continued.

What?
Blood?

If someone needs blood, it is obtained from blood bank and not the clinical laboratory.

I was bemused. My face had a big question mark written all over it.

My mind was trying all permutations and combinations of assumed circumstances of the boy sitting in front of me. Is he into some kind of black magic?

New recipe for a cocktail?

Drugs may be, and needs it for some concoction.

The boy was sitting patiently and was looking at me waiting for my reply.

“And why on earth would you need few ml of blood?” I had to ask as the boy was not forthcoming with any explanation.

“Sir, I need it to write a letter to the girl I like.” He was as innocent as ever.

Wows. This is ingenious. I have heard boys writing love letters in blood to girls. Seen in movies too. But they all nick themselves, take out blood and write with it.

“Aren’t you supposed to write with your own blood?” I needed the clarity.

“I did once Sir, for other girl last year. Blood got clotted before I could finish writing the letter. She did not accept my proposal. The nick got infected and pained for many days. Pain was more than the heart ache. So this time I thought of this simple solution.” He enlightened me.

Now, that’s impressive.

So we went to the lab and coaxed the technician to spare few ml of blood.

“Do you need any specific blood group?” I asked.

“Not really Sir, I don’t think she will cross check the blood group with mine.” He was clear.

He thanked profusely and left. I told him to let me know the outcome. Though I did not expect to see him ever, unless he needed to write more letters.

And does it really impress a girl? I wonder. Words express feelings.

Blood would provide what kind of value addition?

May be the girl can get to know the blood group of the suitor and check the compatibility with her own. She can also get it checked for general health of the boy and rule out any disease.

And these are the boys who slit their thumb with knife to put blood on girls’ forehead if she agrees to marry. The girl washes off the blood from her forehead and the boy is left to get regular dressings on his thumb. He is unable to use that hand for many days.

It carries so much risk to the writer as well as the recipient, with every day discovery of new infections. May be such letters should be sanitized, and written and read with mask and gloves on.

“Is that a love letter in blood?” Mom asked the daughter who had just sprayed sanitizer on the letter and put on gloves to read it.

“How do you know?” Daughter is impressed with mom’s inference.

“I too received many, but there were no viruses in those days.” Mom replied.
