“Are we shifting home?” I asked my wife as I entered the room.

Every surface in the room was full of clothes. The almirahs were wide open. Bed box was staring at me with its mouth spewing out more clothes.

The wife stopped moving. She looked at me for 12 seconds. I am sure she must be counting till 10 before replying to my seemingly innocent question. But from her looks, I am sure she perceived the question as quite stupid.

After counting 10, she controlled herself and said, “No, you are shifting to the other room till this mess is cleared.”

“And why this mess?” My next innocent question. And again perceived as stupid.

“Because I have to take out the winter clothes and pack in the summer ones.”

Now this is such a middle class thing.

English people did this on a grander scale. They shifted the capital to Shimla in summers. And back to Calcutta in winters.

J & K government also emulated the thing.

It was called Durbar Move.

What we do is called wardrobe move. Or better, wardrobe switch. Very middle class.

Rich people have different closets for clothes of different seasons. Middle class people have cupboards for current clothes and bed boxes or suitcases for clothes of other seasons. And the clothes switch places every six months.

And it was during one such switching exercise that I walked into the room and was shunted out for couple of days.

If one plans to visit a cold place in the hills during summer, there are no warm clothes available because they have been packed away for the summer. Same is the situation if one wishes to visit a warm place during winter. At the most, one box or one suitcase of clothes is opened and you have to accept whatever comes out of that. You cannot ask for one particular jacket or t shirt.

The clothes switch is followed by a visit to the dry cleaner. Drycleaners thrive on this seasonal switch by the middle class. Earlier they used to charge per item of clothing. Now to make things easier, they have started charging by the kilo of clothes.

I am sure, very soon someone will start a business of storing off-season clothes for the middle class. This will spare the storing space at home. And if you need your favorite jacket or t shirt, all you have to do is send the pic to the storage guy and it will be delivered to your home. Change of season? The van from the storage guy will deliver the appropriate set of clothes and pick up the off season clothes. Of course, at the time of switch, you will get all your clothes dry cleaned and ironed.

And I wont be asked to leave the room till the clothes are sorted.
