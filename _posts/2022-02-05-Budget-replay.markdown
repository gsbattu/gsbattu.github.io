In 1980s, Bata and North Star were the only shoe companies on the Indian horizon. Just like Ambassador and Maruti. Imported goods were a distant dream.

Those were the days when relatives and cousins coming from abroad would bring goodies with them. Happiness of their visit was directly proportional to the size of the bag they carried. Electronics, clothes, toys, shoes – everything was so welcome.

Then there were more enterprising kinds. They would travel to nearby countries and come back loaded with imported stuff of every kind and sell it at a premium. One such man used to visit our house after every excursion abroad and bring along his bag of goodies. We used to call him Smuggler Uncle. Not that we would buy expensive stuff from him, but he enjoyed his cup of tea, I guess.

Once he brought a pair of very nice looking Nike shoes.

“Can I have those?” I asked my father.

“No, we are on a shoestring budget.” He replied back.

“Yes of course, shoestrings would come with the shoes.” May be, I had heard the word ‘Budget’ for the first time, but I was sure about shoestrings and shoes coming together.

He dismissed me with a wave of hand.

After a couple of years, I raised another query.

“Why don’t we buy a car?”

“It is out of our budget.” Was the reply.

Budget again. I started looking up the thing in newspaper. Every year there would be much hullabaloo about budget.

Sometime in near future and with some luck, a television set happened to be within our household budget and was installed with much fanfare.

From newspaper, ‘Budget’ was taken over by the TV. So many experts suddenly mushroom and discuss the various aspects of the union budget. There are experts from the media, business houses, army, agriculture, education, London School of Economics, and political parties.

One wonders how a budget can go wrong with so many experts giving inputs to the finance minister.

To understand why our shoestring budget could not get me the imported shoes, I listened to all the discussions on the TV. They all seemed to make sense initially.

I listened to long budget speeches made in the parliament. Only interesting part was the Urdu couplets so often used during the narration. I was unable to make out whether the finance minister listened to all those experts on the TV discussion panels or not. The minister seemed to have a mind of his/ her own.

Then there were post budget discussions. The ruling party would declare the budget visionary and proclaim that it would transform the economy of the nation.

The opposition would claim it to be a disaster. They see no benefit for the people on shoestring budget. Common people and taxpayers just have a look and go back to their routine of earning wages.

The panelists on TV would appear again and this time lament that their advice was not followed. May be the finance minister was busy preparing the budget and missed out on the recommendations of the panelists. TV discussions should happen well in advance so that the minister has enough time to analyse all the inputs and then formulate the budget.

The whole scene is repeated year after year. I have not seen any change ever since I learnt the spellings of ‘Budget’.

“Can I have a super play station.” My son asks.

“No, we are on a shoestring budget.” I have inherited the reply.

I dismiss his query with a wave of hand.

Finance ministers are much smarter. They dismiss all the queries with a sleight of hand.

Given all the exposure and experience, I too have my advice for the whole world. If the countries stop fighting wars with each other and abolish all the arms and military budget, the surplus money can be used for the welfare of the population. No one would be denied healthcare and no one will go to sleep on empty stomach.
