Tommy was no ordinary dog.

City dogs are either fully domesticated or fully stray. Domesticated ones are really pampered and usually travel by car. Stray ones are busy evading the stones thrown by urban kids or evading the net of corporation teams.

Dogs in rural areas are semi domesticated. They belong to some family by general consent. Otherwise they roam about everywhere in the village and everyone feeds them. Dogs do not go to school to study. Village dogs sometimes just follow the kid of their master to school. Tommy was one such dog.

Tommy would go to school with his favorite child and while away his time sitting around the class which was held in the open. Sometimes he would play with the other dogs who had come visiting, like him. School staff did not mind the dogs, as the dogs kept them amused and helped them while away their time. Watching dogs play or trying to teach them new tricks, was more entertaining than teaching kids, who were not interested in learning anything.

It was one ordinary day and Tommy was sitting just beyond the class. He was alerted by the announcement made by the teacher – “Today we shall learn the story of the greedy dog.”

What? Tommy was curious. He sat up and listened to the story. He was shocked. It was such a demeaning tale.

Tommy shared the experience with his coterie. All were shocked. How could the man, who claims dog to be his friend, be so double faced? They all discussed the matter and decided to send a memorandum to the teacher to delete the story from the annals of education.

“We the dog fraternity, wish to bring the following points to your notice:

You must have tried many animals before declaring us your best friend. And since then, we have played our part of the bargain to a perfection. We follow you everywhere and perform tasks which seem dangerous to you. We wonder what your experience must been when you tried a donkey or a baboon to guard your house or sniff out bombs. Else, try teaching a turtle to catch a thief.

We tried to locate someone related to our kin mentioned in your story of the so-called greedy dog. With great difficulty we were able to connect with the direct descendant of the dog-in-story. When we narrated the story to him, his breathing stopped and his heart came to his throat. It took him sometime to move his heart to its original position and start breathing again.

It was then he told us the original version. His ancestor was crossing the bridge with a meat loaf in his mouth when he saw his reflection in the water. To him, the dog in the reflection seemed weaker than himself. He was filled with empathy and dropped the meatloaf for the other dog to consume. It was actually an act of compassion and sacrifice for somebody in need.

And someone from your community construed the story and turned it into an anecdote of greed, to suit your idea of teaching the morals to your kids.

We dogs are simple creatures. We don’t twist stories to suit our designs. It is the characteristic of mankind, which is no longer kind. We have seen plenty of cases where simple stories were convoluted for personal gains, which otherwise harmed the peaceful communal canvas of the country.

As far as the moral of the story is concerned, you can find more blatant examples of greediness in your own fraternity. And we are sure, your kids will learn better from those stories.

Joining us in protest are the hare that you made to lose to the turtle, the wolf about whom you made people believe that he deceives by hiding under sheep’s clothing, the duckling that was not ugly, the fox who could not pluck grapes, and many more.

We have seen plenty of such examples in humans. Request not to project animals in a slanderous way in such concocted stories. Instead, quote real examples from your own everyday heroes and leaders.”

Signed – Tommy.
