I have been an admirer of the fairer sex ever since I was born. I don’t think that is a unique emotion for me alone, as all men have the same feeling. May be it’s about the Y chromosome.  But not all the fairer sex tribe has been an admirer of me. I blame that on two many X chromosomes.

Not that all the fairer sex community has been unfair to me. There were few who added fair spark in my life before dumping me for someone who was better endowed with Y. But now that I look back on my life, I guess I am still having the last laugh. That is just a guess because I don’t know whether they are also laughing or not. No, I am not trying to console myself.

There have been many famous and infamous pickup lines, let me present one of the dumping line that was used on me.

“You are such a sweet guy, but then your friend is taller than you, so I am going with him.”

What?!!!??

I looked at her. I looked at my friend. She pointed out his height versus mine. He just shrugged his shoulders above my head.

“Haven’t you heard the dictum – Size doesn’t matter?” I pleaded.

“I am not talking about that size, idiot.” They both walked away.

I was wondering what the advantage of extra height is. For that reason, Giraffe should be the favorite pet animal of all the girls. I could not imagine anything in routine life that a taller man could do and I could not. I fit better in clothes and in cars. Economy class seats don’t bother me. I don’t have to ask the person in the front to adjust his seat for me. I am so cuddlable.

I think she needed someone who could clean the ceiling fan while standing on the floor. Or pluck dates for her. Reach out to the top shelf in stores. May be he will get a job in the submarine where he can actually act as periscope – imagine his neck and head sticking out of sea and looking around for enemy ships.

Tall people are so demanding. They need extra leg room, headroom, elbow room. I am sure, the “I-am-so-smitten-by-the-tall” girl must be running out of space in the room. He must be sleeping diagonally in the bed. He must be experiencing different temperatures and oxygen levels at that height.

She left me for those extra inches that are of no use?

I am good at five feet and a half. I am not alone. I have the company of Napoleon, Beethoven, Picasso, Dustin Hoffman, to name a few. Though my personal favorite is Tom Cruise.

May be she has realised by now – size doesn’t matter.
