“Who will win the elections?”

I dread someone asking that question while sitting in a group. Not because I am not interested in the future of the country, but because the question makes everyone an expert on the topic. Everyone has his own opinion which is different from every other participant. And every person believes his expertise on the topic is better than everyone else. So if there are four persons, we will have prediction of four different governments. If I get to speak, I ask them what is the source or logic of their prediction. For that, usually they have only one answer – ‘I know it.’ I never get to know how they know it.

To gain something out of the inconsequential babble, I try to coax them into betting beer over their claims. That they refuse.

We have experts on every subject.

Covid contributed the maximum experts to the world. While the world health authorities were non-committal, we had covid experts in plenty. Whosoever had survived the disease, or whose close relative had succumbed or even the person whose neighbor had contracted the virus, became an expert. People developed their own medication regimes. The recommended drugs changed more frequently than the virus changed its genome sequence. There were thousand types of masks being recommended by thousand experts. When the option of vaccination became available, we had readymade experts on that also. There were two kinds of vaccines, and the experts were equally divided over the efficacy of both. I listened to both the groups and then left it to the expertise of  the government doctor to decide for me. The doctor decided the issue based on the availability of brand of vaccine rather than the merits. When finally the virus caught up with me despite the fully vaccinated status, it took me sometime to decide which expert to follow.

Then we have experts on marriage ceremonies. On every marriage, one of the relatives becomes the expert on sequence of events and rituals to be followed. This is in addition to the religious expert who is there to conduct the ceremonies.

I wonder how the dictating relative became an expert on marriage:

I was thinking if the bride or the groom can sue the expert in case marriage does not work out.

The experts at the cremations are a world apart, literally. The rituals they prescribe are quite complicated. The bereaved family follows every dictum, their primary concern is salvation of the departed soul. I see a paradox here and hope one such expert will explain it to me one day. When the soul has already departed, how do the things that we do to the body at cremation, affect the destiny of the soul?

Dead bodies tell no tale and souls don’t come back to tell how the rituals affected them.
