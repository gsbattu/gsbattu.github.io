I wonder who started this custom of New Year Resolutions.

I mean, why only at the dawn of new year? I make resolutions all throughout the year. And break them equally regularly. Like, whenever I get tummy upset, I make a resolution to stop eating outside food. And I break it soon.

Whenever I get admonished for not contributing to the household chores, I make a resolution to participate. But then I tend to lose track.

If you enjoy making resolutions and then breaking them, why wait for the arrival of new year? Have fun throughout the year.

We asked hundred married men (courtesy Steve Harvey) what their new year resolutions were. Here are the top five answers:

1. Joining a gym – almost all the married men are conscious of protruding tummy and creaking weighing scale. Other motivating factors are smart female members of the gym, and chance to stay out of home. Many of the guys said if they stand in front of the treadmill, it seems as if the lady is running towards them. Gym owners are aware of this popular resolution and come out with the best offers in January.

2. Keeping the wife happy – after getting the daily dose from the wife throughout the year, many a husbands decide to lead a peaceful life at home by keeping the wife happy. They decided this many times a year, and falter as many times. Finally they make it a new year resolution. None survive past January.

3. Not complimenting other women – this resolution comes from lessons learnt in a bitter way. Unchecked emotions or a mug of beer, sometimes allow a soft whistle to escape on seeing a sparkling damsel. And then the wife makes sure that the husband sees sparkling stars in the day.

4. Coming back home in time – wives are good at catching a liar who is supposedly working extra hours at the office but actually is enjoying himself at a pub with friends. So happily or otherwise, husbands make this resolution of reaching home in time in the evenings. Their willpower is shaken by the invite of friends who are going out to enjoy and the instigation from them.

5. No resolution – these are the real veterans of married life who have realised that nothing ever works in marriage and it is better to relax and enjoy life.

It is good to make resolutions. It shows your understanding of the problems that you face. To stick with it or to abandon it, again shows your analytic powers. Go ahead, make a resolution for 2025.
