“You are late by two years.” The office lady informed me.

“What? I am talking about  admission next year.” I tried to clear the things.

“You are late by two years.” She repeated to make things clear to me.

My son was two years old and would need admission to LKG next year.

Believing that the son will be the next Einstein, I had prepared a list of local schools in order of their credentials. Like every middle-class parent, government schools were ruled out. Bright son needed to shine over and above his peers.

This was my first visit to first school on my list. My enthusiasm of bright future of the child was cut short by such a dry response from the lady at the desk. I had just asked for the registration form for admission, for the next year. And I thought I was approaching the school way early.

I was feeling so illiterate. I was about to leave office when I realised I can at least help my next child.

“Oh ok, that’s my bad. Anyways give me form for registration for the year, two years from now.” I apologised for my lack of information on admission process of the most sought after school in the city.

“You have a younger child?” she asked me.

“I don’t have, but will plan soon. Please let know what would be the right date and month to conceive so that the child is right age for admission.” I was genuinely curious.

She was not impressed. But it was her duty to answer to all my queries.

“Next time I don’t want to be late. I shall deposit the form as soon as the pregnancy test comes positive.” That was my brilliant idea of being the early bird.

“No sir, we need the name, gender and date of birth to be mentioned in the form.” She put a hold on my brilliance.

“No worries. I will take the form to the delivery room and get back to you from there only.” I could not jeopardise career of my next child.

“No sir, you will need to attach birth certificate also.”

Applying for a driving license was much easier.

And I have to convince my wife to conceive as per the schedule provided by the school.

“So I make available all the documents in the right year and the child gets the admission?”  Inference seemed logical to me.

“No sir. There will be interview for the parents and there will be interview for the child.” She informed. I hoped she is not in the interview board, I could see she had already rejected me.

“You are not giving admission to the parents, so why interview them?” I was more dumbfounded than ever.

“Sir, we need to see whether the parents can afford the school. Also, if they have the right education and can spare time for teaching the kid.” She explained.

“Why would we teach the kid? Aren’t we sending the kid to school for the same reason?” I was confused now. Suddenly I had my doubts about the school.

“Sir, schools have one teacher for the whole class. If you want your kid to shine, you have to pitch in with teaching.”

No one told that to my parents. They depended solely on the education provided by the school. Now I realise why my education was not world class.

“And why interview the innocent kid who doesn’t even know what he or she will be going through for next so many years?” I felt bad for the kid. Education is a mental trauma, I have always felt.

“Sir the kid should know ABC, should be able to identify colours, count up to 10 and able to converse in English.” She further enlightened me.

What? May be I will need to send the kid to some other school, to be able to clear the interview of this school.

I collected the form and left the school, wondering about the veracity of the whole process.

Bigger challenge was to convince the wife about timely conception for the sake of the child and not for any vested interests of mine.
