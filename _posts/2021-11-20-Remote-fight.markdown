Our matchmaker had stated under oath that we were perfect match for each other. We stood before the holy man and took our vows in the presence of holy book. “We will stand by each other through thick and thin.” That is when we got married. Very soon the definition of thick and thin changed.

“Honey” I called out during the night.

“Yes?” wife responded in a sleepy grunt.

“Can you please switch off the fan, I am feeling cold.” I stated.

“Get a blanket for yourself.” She suggested a more practical approach.

I was trying to recall how did we decide, who will sleep on which side of the double bed. I was wondering whether her choosing the bed on the side that had switches, was by design or it just happened. She just has to extend her arm to adjust the speed of the fan or to switch it on or off. For me, the options are either to stretch myself across her or to walk around the bed. In any case, even before I settle back in my bed, the action is undone by her, the controls are at arm’s length for her.

I have this feeling that the air in the room gets stale if all the windows of the rooms are closed. So, I tend to keep at least one window open even in the dead of winters. Wife refused to believe this theory of mine. She wanted all the windows closed in winters, so that no cold air enters the room. This has developed into a much evolved cat and mouse game now. I open one window and draw the curtain to cover it so that she does not notice it. But whenever I check it again, the window is closed. I tried with ventilators placed high up.

Same result. I open them in a stealth manner. They get shut in a more stealth manner. I make sure she is not watching when I open a window or ventilator. She acts equally smart; I have never seen her close a window or ventilator.

Things continue in summer. I am very comfortable with AC temperature at 23 0 . Sometime during the night, I would feel cold and look at the AC. It is set at 20 0 . I fumble for the remote in the dark and set the temperature back to 23 0 . I wake up again after some time to find that temperature again set at 20 0 . And I swear I don’t even see her move. I again fumble for remote in the dark. But this time I fail to locate the remote. It has disappeared. I remember the dictum, “get a blanket for yourself”, and I do the needful.

TV remote has more peaceful life. It is very rare that we both agree to see the same programmes. I am more into news, science and documentaries. She likes Netflix. Whosoever is watching TV, has to use headphones. This practice gives acoustic relief to the other person and true stereophonic experience to the user. In case the other person can not tolerate the visuals also, the only option is to leave the room and shift base to some other place in the

house. In case both are watching the same programme, the remote has its quota of tug of war. This time it is for volume control.

Thank God we are not using Alexa as yet and controlling smart devices through it.

“Alexa, switch off the fan.”

“Fan switched off.”

“Alexa, how dare you? Switch on the fan.”

I am sure Alexa will come up with – “Alexa can not work in a conflict zone. Alexa is switching itself off. Please revert to manual controls.”
