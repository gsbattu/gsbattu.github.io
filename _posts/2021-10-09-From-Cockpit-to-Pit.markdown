“I cancelled my tickets.” I announced as if reading out weather report.

“What?” was the collective response of every other family member sitting at the dining table.

“I cancelled just my tickets, you all are going.” I was trying to sound casual while adding salad to my plate.

Being in the cockpit of a two seater, single engine plane was an exhilarating experience always. Besides flying, it is like driving in a 3D environment where you can turn not only left and right, but up and down also. It was a wonderful experience being a trainee pilot in the local aviation club and I loved every moment of being in the cockpit – taking off, manoeuvring the plane in open skies and then landing back.  That was more than 35 years back.

Three years back an opportunity arose to travel to USA to attend a family function. I was so happy. Being in a plane has its own charm. Someone commented – “Additional benefit of having you on board is, you can steer the plane to safety in case something happens to the pilots.”

Can I? All I could do was wonder. But the innocuous comment added unknown fear to my mind. What happens if the pilots are incapacitated? Thoughts of shuddering plane set off shudders that started in my brain and travelled to my toes.

It was then I realised that I will not be sitting in the cockpit, I will be deep in the pit of plane. Claustrophobic that I am, I was thinking how to escape ‘incapacitated pilots’ situation, when I realised there is no way to escape from a plane. It is such a closed place.

Can I open the doors? No.

Can I open those small windows? No.

How many people on board? Hundreds.

Panic started bubbling in the mind.

“How to handle claustrophobia in a plane” I searched online.

There I found limited steps to check phobia, but unlimited stories of panic where hysterical and frightened passengers had to be offloaded. Not at all helpful. Culmination of the panic was getting up in the middle of the night and cancelling my ticket.

That is what I announced to the family.

One year later another opportunity presented.

“Marriage of sonny boy has been fixed for September, get ready.” Announced the call from abroad.

This time the lure of Disneyland and Las Vegas tilted the scales. I decided not to think about the pit or look up online. I will be the pilot, I decided.

Ride to the airport was comfortable. Check in was smooth. I had my plan ready.

“Let us try some drinks.” I announced as I looked around the facilities available.

We went to the first restaurant offering drinks. One drink was costing more than a bottle !!!

“Let us check the other restaurants.” I was acting the wise man.

Visit to all the restaurants produced same observation.

So we settled for the best ambience and ordered a drink. The drink had its affect on the perception of cost and more drinks were ordered.

Boarding was announced. Way to the plane was through a narrow tunnel. Thankfully some parts were transparent and one could look out. That was one panic point survived.

Another panic point was when doors were closed and the pit was being pressurised. We were being instructed on how to use life jackets.

Life jacket? A parachute under my seat would be more comforting.

I passed that panic point by looking at the crew acting out, as if performing a synchronised dance show.

People had warned me about turbulence. We did encounter that. But it was a feeling exactly that I have in car while negotiating roads with lots of pot holes. That day I realised, drinks can also serve as turbulence absorbers, just as shock absorbers. The flight was a pleasant one. We landed safe and sound without any need of panic.

While checking up on panic, I read somewhere that it is the thought of panic that triggers panic. It was such a simple statement but has profound practical implications. I did not think about panic and I did not panic. So friends, whatever phobia you have, just stop thinking about it. Transition from cockpit to pit can be a smooth one.
