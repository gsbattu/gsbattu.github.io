“We will miss the flight”. Wife said. We were on the way to airport for our maiden overseas venture. There were some traffic issues like jams and snarls. I was apprehensive too.

“How can you say that?” I appreciated the fact that we were facing the threat. But still, the situation was under control, we had started early.

“It is my gut feeling.” She replied.

“What do you mean?” I was trying to figure out if we could adopt some other approach to reach the destination in time. Appreciating feelings of her gut was slightly out of syllabus at the moment.

“Haven’t you heard about gut feeling?” She challenged my intelligence.

“I have heard about that, but tell me how do you hear your gut.” I was sure, no one can answer that question.

She did not like my question and chose to ignore me.

I don’t know how people listen to their guts. Any time my gut speaks to me, I have to rush to the loo or to a doctor. Once it spoke so much, appendix had to be taken out to silence it.

What is the seat of emotions and feelings? Is it heart or is it brain? Mind added to the confusion and then there comes another player, gut.

“This is what I think.” When someone says this, it means brain is at work.

“This is what I feel.” This sentence denotes that heart is at work.

“This is my gut feeling.” What does this mean?

Come on man. Let the gut produce acid and squeeze out the nutrients from whatever rubbish we eat. And then it has to store the waste till it is possible to evacuate. When does the gut gets time to analyse a situation and convey the recommendations to the owner? That is the eternal confusion with me.

Once I proposed friendship to a girl.

“We won’t get along well.” She said.

“And how can you predict that?” I was confused. May be she had done post-graduation in astrology.

“I know.”  She responded adamantly.

“Like how?” I asked. I needed clarification before letting it pass.

“I have this gut feeling.”  She said. I was being rejected by the gut of a girl. That was a guttery feeling.

“Okays….let me also check that gut feeling.”  I stretched my hand towards her tummy. She recoiled in horror and never talked to me again.

I realised her gut feeling was right. We did not get along.

It was so intriguing, I got enamoured by it.

“Do you have any gut feeling?” I started asking every acquaintance of mine. Responses were:

1.Yes

2. No

3. Sometimes

4. Have you gone mad? (This was the most common response).

I studied many cases of gut feeling. My findings were:  this phenomenon happened:

1.Mostly in women

2. In men, who are considered substantially more intelligent than others.

One evening, I decided to impress the wife.

“I have a gut feeling.” I announced.

She looked at my tummy. She looked at me.

May be I did not sound intelligent enough.

“Okay, use the loo, but don’t take long.” She dismissed my intelligent perception.

“No, I have this gut feeling that friends will drop in today for drinks.” I tried my level best to have an intelligent and achiever’s look on my face.

She looked at me again. She kept looking at me for 10 seconds. And in those ten seconds, my gut passed through many feelings. I just shrugged my shoulders. May be that gesture will validate my gut feeling.

She smiled. Then she laughed.

“Okay, tell me how many are coming so that I can make arrangements.”

“Three.” I said.

“When did you make the programme?” she asked so casually.

“Today, during the morning walk.” As soon as I said that, I knew I was trapped.

It was gross intelligence failure on the part of my gut feeling.
