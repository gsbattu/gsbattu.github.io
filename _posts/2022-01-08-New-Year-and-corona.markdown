I could hear the chimes.

I could see the welcome celebrations.

There was no knock on the door.

Still, we welcomed it with all our might.

“Welcome 2022” was the chorus.

“Hello. I am Time. It is nice to be welcomed so warmly, year after year,” smiled Time.

I smiled back. “Last year it was 2021.”

“That was me only.” Time replied. “You all are moving with me, but you don’t realise it. Every year is a milestone that we cross together ever since you learnt to count.”

Come to think of it, Time is right.

“I have been here since the beginning of the universe. You guys arrived just recently and learnt to measure me,” said Time.

Very true, I thought.

“And you guys have just learnt to measure me, you still have to learn to value me. You know it, but you don’t realise that I am taking you along, I am pushing you in the direction of future. You don’t have the option of going back.”

Of course, I know it. But then, do I really make use of that knowledge? I don’t think so.

“Don’t celebrate end of one year and beginning of a new one. That’s is just a measurement of time. Celebrate every moment at hand. Once I take you to the next moment, this moment will be gone forever.” That was such a simple but profound advice from Time himself.

Another visitor came along.

I had malaise and fever on first of January.

I went to the hospital and offered my nose to be probed with a swab. Finger in the nose can be a helpful activity and acceptable intrusion, but the swab was a new experience altogether. It went deep and deep as if to reach my brain. Out it came and was dipped in some solution.

I got a call after sometime. “Sir, you are positive for Covid 19.”

Getting a disease with time stamp of 2019, in 2022 seemed retrograde.

“Who invited you?” I asked corona.

“You were welcoming 2022 with such a gusto, I could not control myself and hitch hiked.” Corona smiled.

“No, you are not welcome.”

“Don’t say I came uninvited. You had been advised to wear masks and keep away from each other. I have been knocking at your doors for two years now. You personally invited me by ignoring warnings and letting your guard down.” Said Corona with a straight face.

I know that also. And Time has made sure I can not go back to those days and wear a mask and cancel unnecessary get togethers.

Time to be confined to a room for a week at least. Every cough gives rise to fear of lungs giving up. Pulse oximeter is the saviour and morale booster.

Also, the time to retrospect. Have I used my time wisely? Nothing I can do about the moments gone by, all those moments that have added up to the years. There are so many things I wish I did not do, other things that I could have done differently and a long list of things that I wanted to do. I could have been helpful to so many people when I chose to look the other way. So many people whom I should thank for all the help. Should let know the people whose little gestures added a smile to my life.

Time to live every moment.

And to keep Corona out.
