Like the Shakespearean dilemma, I too have a dilemma – to rise early or not to rise early. There have been conflicting inputs at various stages of life.

Bird Story

“Get up son and go have your breakfast.” It was mother of little birdy who was trying to convince her son to get up early so that he could catch the worm and grow into a handsome strong bird. It had taken the parent birds lots of efforts to produce the child. Mother was more flustered than the father. She did not remember who the father of her child last season was.

She had to find the twigs to build the nest. Laying the egg was painful process. Then she had to incubate the egg so that the embryo inside was baked at the right temperature. Father was kind enough to get her food while she was keeping the egg warm. She was envious of the other species on earth who gave birth to young ones instead of laying eggs. When the egg was ready to be laid, it knocked from inside her and she did the needful. She would have so much spare time if she did not have to incubate the eggs. She had to protect the egg from predators. When the little one was ready to emerge from the egg, it knocked from inside and again she did the needful. And now when the kid was old enough to fly and catch worms, it preferred sleeping over catching worms.

“You look so weak.” She was evaluating him with motherly eyes. I have seen many kids putting on weight because of this faulty motherly evaluation.

The young birdie was more of sleep lover. Or may be like present day kids, he was more into gaming all night. “Mom don’t be bothered, I have become vegan. I will get my breakfast whenever I get up. Half the households keep water and grains for my kind. God bless them all.” He turned over and slept. Mother was worried how will he develop preying instincts. It was becoming more and more difficult to find worms even early in the day. She was wondering about less worms in the mornings. Have the birds already consumed almost all the worms?

What will the future generations eat?

Worm Story

“Mom I am hungry. Can I go out and eat?” the little worm was asking his mother. “No son, it is too early. There might be those orthodox birds who still feel they can catch a worm early in the day. I am so worried about your father. Sometimes he gets late and comes back early in the morning after drinks with his friends. Birds might take him as nonveg snack stuffed with liquor.”

She replied.

It had taken the worms few generations to understand why many of their clan do not return home when they go out early in the morning. Worms were busy making their way and looking for food on the ground and birds would dive from above and pluck them. It was so unfair. It was left to the wisdom of a genius worm who had tripped and had rolled over. He was lying on his back when he witnessed a bird swoop down like a laser guided missile and when it went back to the skies, it had a worm in its beak. It was a eureka moment for the worm lying on its back. Finally he had solved the mystery of disappearing worms in the early morning.

Human Story

Early to bed, early to rise, we too have been taught this dictum. I am sure the first half was invented by the parents who encouraged their young kids to sleep early, so that they could have some ‘We Time’ and indulge in ‘We Pleasures.’ Early to rise, must have been incorporated to make sure that kids have finished their homework and leave for school in time. Kids could not finish their homework in the night because the parents encouraged them to sleep early so that parents could finish their homework.

I am still confused. Whom to follow – worms, birds or the parents.
