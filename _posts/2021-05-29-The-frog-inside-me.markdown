Frogs are funny creatures. They have two strong hind legs and a strong tongue. That gives them strength on the rear and at the front.

Front legs are used only to keep their mouth clear of ground and to land after a jump.

Tongue is not used for talking. It is used for preying. It stays folded in the mouth and then suddenly uncoils and whacks any insect in the vicinity. It is a military precision operation. Sight a target, zero in, whack the tongue and transfer the insect to mouth and then to the hollows of the gut.

Most of the frogs spend their lives in a mundane way. Some of them land in the labs and help humans become doctors or evolve some drugs.
Very few of them are princes. Princes who were turned into frogs by some crafty witch. There are three angles to the transcendental transformation. What did the prince do to annoy the witch? Why did the witch turn the prince into a frog and not some other animal? Why did the witch decide that a kiss from a princess will break the spell?

Here is my take.

Witch was hired to look after the prince and to keep him safe from bad spells of other evil forces. She was expert at riding and driving the broom.

The queen said, “Hey, you are good with your broom. You can clean the floor and remove the webs from the walls and the corners while looking after the prince.”
Thus the witch would ride the broom and do the cleaning. The prince found that very amusing. A witch riding a broom and cleaning, was much more entertaining than a witch that would just sit and tell magic stories.

Often, he would be sitting on his bed with his chin supported by his hands and following the moves of the witch astride her broom.

The witch would make fun of him. “Prince, you look like a frog sitting in that posture.”

Prince would start jumping like a frog whenever she made that comment.

One day the prince tinkered with the gyro and the GPS system of the broom. The broom jumped and had a violent pitch that made the witch hit a wall and resulted in her fall. Her pointed hat saved her head. She pointed her finger at the prince and said, “You sit like a frog, be a frog.”
Whooooosh. The prince become a frog. “Your mother has been looking for a princess for you. Find a princess who is ready to kiss a frog and ye shall be a prince again.” She said and went off to get her broom repaired from Lord Voldemort.

This was a tricky spell. Why would a princess kiss a frog? Unless the frog is made of diamond and presented to her by her father on her birthday. Kissing a real frog can be yukky and unhygienic. What if he whacks out his tongue and tickles her tonsils? Moreover, how to tell a male frog from a female one, to begin with. Still he managed to salvage a golden ball and emotionally blackmailed a princess to kiss him.

The story inspired each and every frog. They all wanted to be kissed by a princess to reach their full potential or to achieve their actual form. They might be princes. Or maybe, someone more worthy. They might be some other life form. But they can only find out if they get a kiss from a princess.
I too have been wondering. Many a times I feel I could have done better in life. I feel, I have the potential in me to do so many things in life. Things that the world will appreciate and also earn me treasures. May be I already have treasures stashed away somewhere, but the spell has made me forget about it. I actually belong to some other planet and am the future ruler. May be I am a great artist, museums will vie for my artwork.

I have a great theory. I also need a princess to kiss me and transform the frog inside me to someone great. I am ready for a kiss from a non-princess, that might take me to halfway at least, of my full potential.

My wife is not impressed with the theory. “For me, one frog in hand is better than a prince far away.”

The frog inside me remains a frog.
