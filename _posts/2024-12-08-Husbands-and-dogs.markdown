It was men’s day out.

We were all in a pub enjoying drinks.

One of us seemed quite off color.

“Why are you sad, our dear friend?” we all asked him.

“My wife loves our dog more than she loves me.” He said after initial hesitation.

There was silence. After few awkward moments, another one said, “I am also facing the same situation.”

Soon everyone was in confession mode. Every husband with a family pet dog was facing the same problem.

And no one could find a reason why.

“What is it that dogs have and we don’t have? May be just a tail that they keep on wagging.”

“A dog is supposed to be a man’s best friend. Now they have shifted loyalties and have become woman’s best friend.”

There must be a reason, all concluded. In that moment of high spirits and higher emotions, it was decided to go to one person’s place and talk to the lady of the house, in the presence of the dog.

So we all went to a friends place, whose wife was considered most amicable.

“Bhabhiji, please enlighten us on why wives love their dogs more than their husbands.”

“Because they are so understanding and do whatever is expected from them.” She said while stroking the head of the family dog. “They don’t understand the spoken language, they understand the body language.”

“Can you please elaborate with some example?” We pleaded.

“See, they understand our body language which you guys don’t. When you are in a party and you ask your wife whether you can go around and say hello to your friends leaving her behind, and she says – sure darling – you have to understand the command in her eyes that is telling you to sit down. Don’t leave her for your friends.”

There was a collective ‘oooohhhh’. This never occurred to us.

Man of the house said, “Now I know the reason why you were not talking to me for two days after that.”

She continued further. “Similarly, when the wife introduces you to her female friends, register the command in her eyes – Do not spread your wings too much and keep your distance.”

We were nodding heads. We always were so happy being introduced to females, that too by the wife. A handshake or a hug always seemed so legal.

She was in full flow now.

“If the wife feels that the husband has had more alcohol than the quantity that suits him, she might even ask the husband – do you want another drink, dear – the husband has to understand the command in her tone that says leave the glass. And in case you are getting cozy with her female friend more than required, she may tell you – why don’t you sit next to her and chat with her – the command is to leave.”

One by one we all recollected the moments when we actually had another drink or sat with the female. We were so happy that the wife is such a sport and were totally at sea when she fought for the same reason.

Body language more than spoken words. And that is where dogs are hundred times better than men.

“And lastly,” she smiled and said, “if the wife says -sorry darling, I have headache – the husband should understand the command, roll over to the other side of the bed and go to sleep.”

That’s a lot to learn. Else, the dog will always be loved more.
