“Don’t worry, nothing will happen to him.” Said the other friend.

We were having beer on the terrace of our hostel late one evening. The terrace had no parapets. Suddenly there was a commotion somewhere below. We went to the roof edge to see what was happening. It was then that I leaned out extra.

“Be careful, don’t fall down.” Warned one of the friends.

That is when the other friend replied, “Don’t worry, nothing will happen to him, he won’t hit the ground hard, he will float down like a leaf falling from a tree.”

This was a tribute to my petite body frame.

I think I have a small body frame because I was born slightly premature. Or maybe my mother did not care about her diet while I was in womb. Maybe her body stores were exhausted while carrying my elder siblings.

There are so many advantages to this seemingly disadvantage of not being huge. Many were discovered by me and others were described by friends.

Travelling while I was still a kid, had special perks for me. The amount of space that I needed to sit was easily created by slight shifting of bums of those who occupied all the seats. People found it easy to accommodate a small child than a grown up adult. Being small had its own economic advantages. My mom kept on buying half ticket for my travel even when I was well past the eligible age. “Just keep quiet if someone asks you your age, let me speak.” She would instruct me. Kids like me, travelling on half ticket were not eligible for a seat. If need be, mom would make me sit in her lap, an easy feat for I was such a light weight.

Every function in school would need kids to stand in a row. Teachers used to make a row as per their preferences of the kids.

“Come Johnny, stand in the first position.” Favourite student would be called to the fore.

Sometimes the rows were made as per expertise of the kids for the event.

“Charlie, you stand in front. He is the best for this position.” Other teacher would say.

But when all those responsible for the function would sit down for the final format, invariably the rows would be done size wise, and I always moved to the front!!!

And when kids were being scolded by the teacher, it was easy for me to hide behind anyone larger than me. Many a times I succeeded in avoiding getting reported to the parents, as teacher in that fit of rage, failed to notice me. Other times, some mean friend would push me to the front from my safe haven.

“Shall I join army?” was my rhetoric question. We friends had finished our MBBS and were looking at job prospects.

“You will be selected without any test.” A friend commented.

“Am I that good?” I was elated.

“No, because army needs doctors like you to be deployed at front. It will be hard for enemy bullets to hit such a tiny target. Plus, you can walk in the minefield without triggering any mine.” I was deflated without being hit.

And when I went for my marriage, I was made to sit astride on a mare. When the handler pulled the reins to make the mare walk with band in tow, she looked at him as if asking, “Let the groom sit atop first, no?”

Trainer could understand the look in the eyes of the mare and assured her in their own sign language that I was sitting in the designated place. She was relieved of her worries and happily moved forward.

Finally, I was selected for a plum post. I went to an experienced friend for guidance on how to conduct myself.

“Learn to throw your weight around in a judicious manner.” He said with authority.

“What?” I raised my eyebrows as I spread my arms for him to appreciate my weight.

“Leave it.” He shrugged.
