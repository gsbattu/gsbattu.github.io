What?

Even the air here would test positive !!

Come-on guys. Economy of Punjab runs on liquor and we are trying hard to keep it running. Don’t we all want to see a debt free Punjab? It will affect sales of vendors, business of marriage palaces, marriage industry and raddi wallahs. Not to mention all the spurious scotch makers of the state.

Only the cab services will benefit. But they can’t sustain economy.

As per data available, around 3.5% of road accidents happen because of drunken driving. What about the rest 96.5%? If you are drunk, 3.5 chances out of 100 are that you will hit someone. But if you are not drunk, 96.5 chances out of 100 are that someone will hit you.

I was coming out of the marriage palace when I was stopped by the police squad. I stepped out of the car.

“Please blow into this.” The guy in uniform proffered an instrument with a port to blow in.

“And why should I do this?” I asked.

“This will tell us whether you are drunk or not.” He replied.

“Are you my wife?” I asked.

“What?” he was confused.

“Only she has the right and the expertise. Every evening when I reach home, she smells my breath and tells me I am drunk.”

He looked at me suspiciously.

“How do I know this instrument works fine? You blow into this first and let us see what happens.” I
told him.

He took a deep breath and exhaled into the analyser. The reading crossed the red line.

“See, it works.” He was grinning.

“Are you drunk?” I asked him.

“I took few drinks to check the instrument.”

“Let someone else blow into it.” I looked towards other members of his team.

“We all tested it one by one after consuming drinks to make sure it works fine.”

“Why don’t you have people in the team who could check without drinking?” I asked.

“We tried to find volunteers in the force who would not drink in the evening and instead check people. We could find few for Tuesdays and Thursdays, but none for rest of the days.”

Just then a car left the marriage palace, it was being driven by a lady. No one stopped her. I had seen her drinking more than me.

“Why did you not check her?” I asked. Police should not play sexist.

“We are not authorised to check ladies. But if she bangs her car into anything and is taken to hospital, her blood sample will be analysed.”

Good to see respect for females, at least.

“I am not touching that port in which you exhaled. It is unhygienic and covid is still around.” I made my point. “Plus how do we make sure that your breath has been removed from the machine?”

“We are also new users, so don’t know the technical things.”

“Ok. What we can do is, I will blow into a balloon and we will attach the balloon to the port so that I don’t have to touch that thing.” A bright idea was taking shape in my mind.

He hesitated a bit before he agreed.

I went to the entrance of the palace and plucked a balloon from the decoration.

“Here.” I handed over the balloon to the guy.

He dutifully attached the balloon to the port and let go. The machine emitted the loudest beep.

Oh shit. I had not factored in the chances of the guy inflating the balloons being drunk.

“You are lucky, sir. Today is just a warning day. One of our drivers will drop you home, you have to pay his charges only.” He was beaming.

I was delivered to my place.

Time to look for some cab service and tell him to keep me safe from 96.5% accidents. Without drinking.
