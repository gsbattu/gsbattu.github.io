Politics makes strange bedfellows. And marriages make bedfellows strange.

A survey was conducted. A couple was asked – who starts a fight?

“80% of the times, its him.” Wife replied.

“90% fights are started by her.” Husband replied.

That is some efficiency. Here we have 170% output.

What is the most common cause of fight? Husband was asked.

“If I go out with my friends, she doesn’t like it and fights with me.” He replied.

Then you should stay home, no?

“If I stay home, we usually end up fighting.” Said husband.

Do you fight with him, if he goes out with his friends? Wife was asked.

“He is supposed to look after me and the house, no?” she replied.

Then why do you fight with him when he stays home?

“He is so irritating, he gets on my nerves.” Candid confession.

“Also, he doesn’t buy me gifts or diamonds.” Wife complained further.

Why don’t you? Husband was asked.

“I am the best gift she ever got. Plus they taught us in school that beauty needs no ornaments.”

Do you agree?

“Him being the best gift for me is nothing but a sad narcissist joke. And I tell him, in my school they taught us, diamonds are best friends of girls.”

What else contributes to the fights?

Household chores.

What is your contribution to household chores? Was the next survey question.

“Well, I do help her there. If not more, I do contribute 50%.” Husband replied.

“He is of no help at all. I have to do all the work. 100%. He just adds to my workload.” Wife lamented.

Again more than 100% output !!!

Tell us what all you do at home as your contribution to running the home.

“Let him tell first. I do the rest of the things.” Wife was confident.

Sir, please let us know.

“Well…………..” there was a long pause. “Many a times I make my bed in the morning.”

Wife looked at him.

“Ok. Sometimes I make my bed.” Husband rectified himself. “I get the newspaper from the gate.”

“That is only if the maid misses doing that.” Wife quipped in. Husband decided not to refute that.

“I raised kids on my own. I would be awake changing nappies and feeding the kid while he would be snoring.” She added.

“I stayed awake while creating the kid.” Husband presented his side. “Moreover, changing nappies and feeding the kid went side by side. And I am not equipped to feed the child, so better if mother does both the things.”

“That’s why he did not get to make more babies.” She snapped.

It seemed finding the reason of fights was turning out to be another reason for the fight.

But be happy, in many fields, marriages add up to more than 100%.
