“Can you please hand over some old newspapers to me?” Mom asked. (I added ‘please’ to the sentence to please myself). She was on a cleaning spree.

“What do you need them for?” I asked. She just looked at me with ‘that’ look.

“I mean, how many do you need?” this was a better question.

She needed them to spread on the shelves and in the drawers.

Welcome to the middle class, inventors of unlimited nonconventional uses of newspapers.

In my school days, which were spent in the rural hinterland, I used newspapers to cover my school books and notebooks. I liked my books clean. They were always covered. My favorite was magazine section of Sunday newspaper. This was the only section that was printed in color. And sometimes it used glossy paper. I made sure the front of the book always had some beautiful colored picture on it.

In winters we would get the hot peanuts from the vendor. Peanuts were invariably packed and handed over in bags made of newspaper. It was fun to read the paper bag while having peanuts. Best was to go through all the matrimonial advertisements, if that happened to be on the paper bag. All girls are claimed to be beautiful and all boys handsome. And if at home, peanuts would be spread on an old newspaper and family members would sit around it and enjoy the feast.

Newspaper would be crumpled and stuffed in shoes which were not be used for a long period. This was done to maintain the shape of the shoe. From the date of the newspaper one can also guess when this shoe was last used. This practice was also followed to remove the bad odor from the shoes.

In winters, it was a routine to have a bonfire in the evening and all would sit around it and chat while waiting for dinner. And what was used to start the fire? Newspaper. The sheets would be lightly rumpled and placed beneath the firewood. May be, hot and juicy news made the fire start quickly.

During college days, there was a dhaba near the college which was very popular with the students. The guy had neatly cut the newspaper in handkerchief size pieces and kept them near the cash counter. If anyone asked for tissue paper after enjoying snacks or a meal, he was provided with this piece of newspaper to wipe clean the hands.

Till date, majority of the roadside wine shops don’t provide carry bags to take away the bottles of beer or liquor. The bottles are simply individually wrapped in a sheet of newspaper and handed over to the customer. It is amusing to read news of hooch tragedy or drunken brawls in the country on the paper that contains the bottle.

Age old remedy of anything spilling on the floor? Cover it with newspaper which will soak the liquid and make it easier to clean the mess. Only trick is to clean up before it dries, else the chances of newspaper sticking to the floor are very high.

In summers and in days of regular power outages, newspaper was used as hand fan to cool oneself. Invertors had not yet appeared on the scene. Newspaper was rolled and used to swat any annoying fly. Sometimes, fly swatting evolved into match of reflexes if plenty of people were available. Anyone who succeeded would be appreciated and anyone who missed would be made fun of.

I have seen many people who have trained their cats and dogs to ease themselves on an old newspaper spread in some remote corner.

Any newspaper that survived all such innovative uses, was sold to scrap dealer. Even then the instructions were – “Don’t give away all the newspapers. You never know when we might need them.”

And don’t ask me what the Americans used when they ran out of toilet paper during the lockdown.
