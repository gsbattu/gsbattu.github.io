I wanted to buy a new trendy bicycle. It was late 70s. I had the typical stereotype cycle and cool cycles were making their foray in the market. My school was about 3 km away from home.

“But you already have one.” Dad told me. All my reasons, from innocent to clever, failed. May be recycling was not in fashion as yet.

“We have to save for the rainy day,” he would say.

I got the same advice from him many years later when I started earning. “Do save for the rainy day.”

I did not understand exactly what was meant by that.

It happens to be extremely rainy day yesterday. Something the weather department labeled retrieving monsoons. They had not showered that much water while advancing as they did while on the way back.

Let me go through the whole day.

Early in the day I went out to unlock the gates and to collect the newspaper. Newspaper was lying in the puddle of water, all soaked. I tried to pick it up but only the pieces remained in my hand. Ever since the beginning of the rains, I been trying to get hold of the hawker, but he remained as elusive as a prize under the scratch ticket. I just wanted to tell him to put the newspaper in the letterbox and save it for the rainy day. Did not happen.

Pet Labrador could not go out for his morning walk and ablutions. He looked at me.

“It’s raining, buddy, can’t go out.” I told him. He was confused.
For him it had to be the other way round. I told him to save the walk and the ablutions for a sunny day. Poor dog did not understand the logic.

Maid did not come. She saved herself from the rainy day.

On the way to office, roads were waterlogged and traffic was worse than a race between snail and a turtle. And once in office, there was no traffic of customers. Dad should have advised – “If the rain is 25% more than usual for the day, do not go to office.” It was a day of fuel and time not saved.

In the evening the laundry guy came in empty handed. “Sir, clothes did not dry, so will get them back tomorrow. If the sun shines.” Sun must be shining high above, it was the clouds that were mightier yesterday. Sun did not save his energy.

Evening was the time to sit in the verandah and enjoy the drink. Sure shot way to have a happy ending to the woeful day. Alas, there was no home delivery of the snacks because of the rain. Packets of namkeen were fetched from the corner shop. It was not after long that they started getting soggy. I had to hurry up to save their crispiness.

Save what for the rainy day?

I did not understand then and I did not understand yesterday. There must be some deeper, cosmic or divine meaning to the suggestion.
