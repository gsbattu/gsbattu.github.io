“Why haven’t you finished your work?” Mom was furious.

“Will do it sometime. You only told me ‘Better late than never’, I am making it better.” The son replied.

Mom was wondering whose head to bang – her own or the son’s.

The times are changing. Population has increased many folds during the last few decades, and all are competing for the same limited resources. I guess it is time to revisit some of the idioms and caution the kids to know the meaning, but not follow blindly.

Slow and steady wins the race

This was a story that was propagated by the species of the tortoise. The rabbit does not sleep in any race these days. Even otherwise, there is a flaw in the story. Why was the tortoise racing against the rabbit? It should have been a race between a tortoise and a tortoise OR a rabbit and a rabbit. Tell the kids to run fast and not to sleep on the track.

Try Try again

“Don’t worry, keep trying, you will succeed one day.” I have heard this misguiding advice many times in my life. Now I realise it actually wasted my time. Try once, may be twice, max thrice. No point in wasting time beyond that. Just understand that it is out of your league. You are not meant for it. Be it a profession, beau, girl or a job. Think of alternative, earlier the better. Try for the next best, it might turn out to be better for you. It makes sense to excel in whatever is achievable rather than fail in what cannot be achieved.

Burn the boats

“Once you start something new, don’t look back.” This is the advice we all get once in a while. I would suggest don’t burn your boats, instead cover them and keep them usable for some time at least. Burning the boats might sound macho and symbolise one’s faith in one’s own decision making, but it is wise to keep the fall-back option open. If you are quitting a job, make sure you keep the company people in good humour. You might need to join back one day. And if you are breaking up, see to it that it is not bitter.

Your guess is as good as mine

“What is his secret?” a common friend asks you.

Someone asks a question, and you don’t know the answer. Okays, you know you don’t know it, but why announce? You should just keep quiet. Or drop a subtle hint that you know it but will not share it as of now. When the answer is out, you can always claim you already knew it.

A bird in hand is better than two in the bush

This sounds like a deterrent for the ambitious. What stops you from holding the bird in hand and exploring the bush for the other two? Never rest on the laurels earned. There can many other avenues, related or unrelated. May be this idiom was coined by a jealous girlfriend or a wife.

Ignorance is bliss

“You crossed the speed limit.” The traffic policeman informs you.

“Oh, I must have missed the sign.” You say apologetically.

Ignorance is no longer bliss. You cannot escape fine or ticket if you don’t know the traffic rules. Feigning ignorance will make you look stupid and not innocent. Better to know the rules of the game, before indulging in it.

Turn a deaf ear

Information is power. Don’t turn a deaf ear to any conversation, just learn to sieve gold from gibberish. You will be amazed at the information you can gather from a casual information.

Call a spade a spade

“You are a corrupt person.” You can tell a person, but it won’t make much sense. Think of spade as a spade and keep quiet. You never know the ‘spade’ might be high on drugs or might be armed. Safety saves. And calling a spade carries no legal validity. You might have to face a lawsuit for defamation.

Time to have new set of idioms. Sometimes old is not gold.
