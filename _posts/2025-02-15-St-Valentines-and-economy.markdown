“Hello.”

I was trying to connect with the past. The past where it all began. Or, in whose name it all began.

“Hello, is that St Valentines?”

“Hello. Yes, it is me.” Came a guttural response.

“Thank you, sir, for making this world more beautiful with expressions of love.” I was totally overwhelmed by the feelings. Feelings of gratitude towards him and feelings for all the girls who caught my fancy in my life.

“I should be thankful to you people for carrying on the legacy of love.

I had to fight against policies of the king and I was actually executed on this day.” He responded.

I could fathom the deep emotions in the voice.

And to change the hue of the conversation I said, “Did you have access to roses and teddies and cakes to express your love?”

“We believed in organic expression, as in handwritten notes, or verbal communication.” Came the reply.

“That must have been so romantic.” I was trying to imagine the amorous scene being enacted out.

“True.” St Valentines responded. “But at that time it had limited approach.”

“How was that?” I could not understand the meaning of what was said.

“See, we could express out feelings to one person only in our times. People now have means to send flowers or other indications to multiple individuals in real time. Efficiency and reach have certainly improved manyfold. And that definitely increases the success rate.” I could see a grin in the speech.

“Also there was no economic angle to the whole thing in my times.”

The St continued.

“And what do you mean by that.” I regularly fail to understand what saints say.

“Emotions are being fueled by the sellers. Send as many roses, cakes and chocolates as you wish and anywhere, all across the world. Send them to your current likings, ex flames, could have been besties and whomsoever you fancy or fancied. Age and marriage are no bar now.

Just try to imagine the amount of sales generated and revenues collected. Some of the youngsters might actually get married. That will create opportunities for everyone associated with marriage industry. Then there will be jobs for maternity homes, doctors, nannies and schools. Many married couples will generate opportunities for divorce lawyers. And the cycle repeats every year.” St Valentines was getting exhausted while speaking.

And suddenly I was lost in the gigantic numbers and spinoffs of a single rose or a single teddy or a single chocolate.

“All this in my name,” said the Saint, “and I don’t get even a single penny as royalty.”

How amazing I realised.

And I was happy for all the roses that I ever sent across. Though they brought back no response, at least I contributed towards developing a thriving economy for the nation.
