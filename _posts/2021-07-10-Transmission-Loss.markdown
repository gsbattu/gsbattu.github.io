I always wanted to be singer.

Okay, may be that is taking things too far. Not always, I wanted to be a singer when I was in college.

Actually, I just wanted to sing few songs that would be appreciated by the audience. The desire was triggered by the fan following and popularity of the singers in the college. Popularity, may be not all along the year, but at least during the days of annual functions.

I took part in many extra-curricular activities, but singing was never on the list. A singer would just walk on to the stage, grab the mike and prevail upon the audience. Instant hero. It was the support and reaction from female audience, that I wanted to be a singer.

I tried to analyse the traits of a singer. I could be a singer if I could inculcate those traits. Singers came in many hues. There were classical types and there were non-classical types. There were few who would practice in their rooms, others were just spontaneous singers. Few took the singing very seriously, others did not mind making parodies out of original songs. Few were good in studies, others were back benchers and barely passed the exams. Some would sing songs of a particular singer while others could sing any song. Looking for particular traits was a futile exercise. They all were human beings, just like you and me. Only difference was, they could hop on to any stage and sing to the tune.

That was when I decided to sing songs. Not decided, I wished I could sing songs. It could not happen in college. The claps and the cheers of fellow collegians were not my destiny.

The seven year itch is officially not in our culture, so I had this benign itch of singing after many years of marriage and child rearing. I made the announcement that I shall be singing songs at home so that I can be mike ready by the next party. The announcement was welcomed with collective guffaws.

“What?” I was not amused.

“You cannot sing.”

“Why can’t I sing?” I persisted.

“You don’t have the required DNA.”

“I shall train my DNAs.”

That virtually shut off the idea of rehearsing in the presence of others.

Going by the old cliché of ‘bathroom singer’, I tried to hum while in shower. Very soon I would hear a mocking voice from outside. I could not make out and could not ask, whether the mocking act was by design or just incidental.

I tried office lift. Many a times I am alone in the lift and that encouraged me to sing loudly. Lift moves from floor to floor, so the chances of anyone standing outside and listening were almost zero. Though I had to stop whenever the lift stopped and the door opened. Many a times that meant, gap of few floors between the lines or in between a line.

Then I bought a karaoke mike with preloaded lyrics and music. All I had to do was read the lyrics on cue. And unlike my family, it would say ‘good effort’ at the end of song and give me a score which made me feel almost like a professional singer. Now I had a proof of trainable DNAs.

That did not impress the family.

I was trying to analyse my situation. I made a list of songs which I thought I could sing. There are so many nice people in the world who have posted online, lists of songs for budding singers. I heard the songs many times. I read the lyrics many more times. I hummed the tunes and added words in my mind. Everything seemed perfect. Things changed when I tried to give voice to the well-rehearsed process in my mind. Even I could appreciate the gap between the perfect planning in my mind and actual tune that emerged from my voice box.

Now I realize, I have perfect lyrics and tune in my mind. I have a larynx, the voice box, which works perfectly. There seems to be some defect in the command that is being conveyed from the brain to the voice box. A flawless command starts from the brain for a perfect song, but it gets warped on the way and delivers wrong signals to the voice box.

Transmission loss.

Now I am trying to improve the transmission rather than rehearsing the songs.

I shall be on stage one day.
