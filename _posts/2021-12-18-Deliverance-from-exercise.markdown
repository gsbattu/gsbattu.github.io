“Guru ji” I was calling my psychology health mentor.

“Yes, my son?” He knew I call him only when I have some vexing issues on my mind that need his expert opinion.

Beauty of talking to Guru ji is, he understands what I want to hear and makes sure I am at peace after the dialogue ends.

This time I was being bothered by the little achievements being flaunted by my peers.

“Guru ji, I cannot touch my toes.” I presented my first predicament.

“And why do you want to touch your toes?” he asked.

“Because there is a guy, whom I see do it every day.”

“Ask him how that has helped him. Has it increased his IQ or salary? Has it improved his relations with his wife? You need to touch your toes only to trim the nails. That you can do by bending the knees. Same, if you want to pick something from the ground. I don’t see the logic behind touching toes. God wanted humans to walk on two feet. Touching toes seems as if you want to be on your fours like other animals;” Explained Guru ji. Now onwards I shall ask every toe-toucher what he gained out of it.

“I cannot do bench presses like those hunks in the gym.” I presented my next quandary.

“Do you have any worldly issue weighing heavy on your chest?” he asked.

“No.” I replied.

“So, you need not practice bench presses. Those guys in the gym are young, may be they have issues of the heart or profession that they need to lift off their chests. For that, they need to practice bench presses. Keep your conscious clear and you can avoid bench presses.” He cleared my doubts.

“I cannot run five kilometres like others.” Was my next problem.

“Where do people go after running?” asked Guru ji.

“Most of the times, the run ends at the starting point.” I recollected and replied.

“So that explains the futility of running – you are back to the starting point, tired and puffing. You want to run after something?” he asked.

“No.”

“Someone is running after you or you want to run away from something?”

“No.”

“Then why do you want to run? If you start running, one day you will run away from your responsibilities and then everyone will be running after you.”

Point well taken.

“Guru ji, I cannot swim.” I proceeded further.

“Are you a fish?” he asked.

No.

“Are you a tortoise, an octopus or crocodile?” he asked.

No.

“Have you lost something in water that you want to find?”

No.

“That means you are not supposed to swim. All those, God wanted to swim, were born in water or at shore. Try swimming and you will get water and infection in your eyes, ears and nose. You can drown or become food to sharks.” Guru ji is full of wisdom.

“I cannot do push ups.” I continued.

“Push ups, to me they look like as if an animal on its fours is trying to pick food from ground with mouth. Or like a lizard raising its head repeatedly to look around.” Guru ji enlightened me.

“Tell me what you are good at?” It was Guru ji’s turn to question me.

“I am good at sitting in the sun and having peanuts.” I replied after much deliberation.

“That is absolutely fabulous.” Guru ji was ecstatic. “That is back to basics. First humans just ignored sunlight. Then they realised it can be used to cook or heat water. Later they understood its potential to generate electricity. And see, while you eat peanuts, you are gaining energy from the sun, you are absorbing vitamins and rejuvenating your body. All those who exercise, use extra oxygen from the atmosphere and release back more carbon dioxide than you or me. I am not sure whether they are having any personal benefit from exercising, but they sure are using oxygen from your and mine quota.”

Guru ji, as always, put me at ease.

I shall not use extra oxygen.
