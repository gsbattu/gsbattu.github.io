I was born under the sun sign Aquarius. And I always wonder, why dont people who are born at night, have moon signs. Even after spending more than half a century being an Aquarian, I am still not clear what exactly that means. I am sure even the people who exclaim – oh you are an Aquarian – after asking my date of birth, are also not clear about that. It is supposed to be a water sign, but I am more of a soda man !!

I got my schooling, till eighth to be precise, in pure rural schools, in pure Punjabi. Now I call them schools with Green Dot. They are as close to nature as can be - classes under big trees due to lack of rooms, ease out anywhere due to lack of loos, one to one interaction with plants due to lack of official gardener and home made food for the lack of any canteen.



We shifted to Patiala when I was in mid 9th. I was deposited in a government school, considered best at that time. Coming to an English medium school and that too a coeducational one, was a great cultural shock. How can one swear in English and that too in the presence of girls? Managing to overcome all the obstacles with different strategies, I cleared school with noteworthy grades.

MBBS  
DA
